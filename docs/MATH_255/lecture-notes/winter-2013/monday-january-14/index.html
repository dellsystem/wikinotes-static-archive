        <h2 class="header"><i>1</i>Locations of roots<a class="headerlink" href="#locations-of-roots" name="locations-of-roots">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Say we have a continuous function on a closed, bounded interval. We know at some point it is positive, and at another point, negative. Intuitively we understand it must have some root then - a point at which the function is 0. Intuition isn't enough though - let's prove this:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let <span>$I = [a, b]$</span> be a closed, bounded interval and <span>$f : I \to \mathbb{R}$</span> be continuous on <span>$I$</span>. If <span>$f(a) &lt; 0 &lt; f(b)$</span> or <span>$f(b) &lt; 0 &lt; f(a)$</span>, there exists <span>$c \in (a, b)$</span> such that <span>$f(c) = 0$</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> WLOG<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" title="Without loss of generality">1</a></sup> assume <span>$f(a) &lt; 0 &lt; f(b)$</span>. Consider <span>$p = \frac{a+b}{2}$</span>, the midpoint of the interval <span>$[a, b]$</span>. If <span>$f(p) = 0$</span>, we're done. Else, either <span>$f(p) &gt; 0$</span> or <span>$f(p) &lt; 0$</span>. If <span>$f(p) &gt; 0$</span>, consider the interval <span>$[a, p]$</span>. If <span>$f(p) &lt; 0$</span>, consider <span>$[p, b]$</span>. In either case, we end up with a new interval <span>$I_1 = [a_1, b_1]$</span>, with <span>$I_1 \subseteq I$</span>. Once again, we consider the midpoint, <span>$p_1 = \frac{a_1 + b_1}{2}$</span>. If <span>$f(p_1) = 0$</span>, we're done, otherwise, we repeat the process, in general obtaining a new interval <span>$I_n = [a_n, b_n]$</span> such that <span>$I_n \subseteq I_{n-1}$</span> while <span>$f(a_n) &lt; 0$</span> and <span>$f(b_n) &gt; 0$</span> (assuming our process never ends by finding a midpoint <span>$p_n$</span> such that <span>$f(p_n) = 0$</span>). We end up with a sequence of nested closed, bounded intervals, so by the Nested Intervals Property (2.5.2) there exists a common point <span>$c$</span> in each interval.</p>
<p>Based on our method of creating intervals, the interval <span>$I_n$</span> has length <span>$b_n - a_n = \frac{b - a}{2^{n-1}}$</span>. Thus <span>$\lim b_n - a_n = 0$</span> (which tells us that point <span>$c$</span> is unique by Theorem 2.5.3, but we need to prove <span>$f(c) = 0$</span>). As the intervals are nested, the sequence of lower bounds <span>$(a_n)$</span> is increasing, and the sequence of upper bounds <span>$(b_n)$</span> is decreasing. They are both bounded, and therefore they both converge by Monotone Convergence Theorem. As a result we can say the following:</p>
<p><span>$$
0 = \lim b_n - a_n = \lim b_n - \lim a_n \\
\therefore \lim a_n = \lim b_n = L
$$</span></p>
<p>Since <span>$c \in I_n$</span>, it follows that <span>$L = c$</span>. As <span>$f$</span> is continuous, <span>$f(a_n) \to f(c)$</span> and <span>$f(b_n) \to f(c)$</span>. As <span>$f(a_n) &lt; 0$</span>, <span>$f(c) \leq 0$</span>. As <span>$f(b_n) &gt; 0$</span>, <span>$f(c) \geq 0$</span>. Therefore <span>$c = 0$</span>. <span>$\blacksquare$</span></p>
<p>This method of zeroing in on the root is sort of like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a>.</p>
<h2 class="header"><i>2</i>Bolzano's Intermediate Value Theorem<a class="headerlink" href="#bolzanos-intermediate-value-theorem" name="bolzanos-intermediate-value-theorem">&para;</a></h2>
<p>This theorem motivates a more general form - we know that for a continuous function on a closed, bounded interval, if two points in the image have opposite signs, there is necessarily a 0 in the image. What stops us from saying something similar about any point? Bolzano said nothing, and theorem'd it as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem (IVT):</strong> Let <span>$I = [a, b]$</span> be a closed and bounded interval and <span>$f : I \to \mathbb{R}$</span> be a continuous function on <span>$I$</span>. If there exists a <span>$k \in \mathbb{R}$</span> such that <span>$f(a) &lt; k &lt; f(b)$</span> or <span>$f(b) &lt; k &lt; f(a)$</span> then there exists <span>$c \in (a, b)$</span> such that <span>$f(c) = k$</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> If <span>$f(a) &lt; k &lt; f(b)$</span>: Consider <span>$g(x) = f(x) - k$</span>. <span>$g$</span> is continuous on <span>$I$</span>. <span>$g(a) = f(a) - k &lt; 0$</span> and <span>$g(b) = f(b) - k &gt; 0$</span>, thus <span>$g(a) &lt; 0 &lt; g(b)$</span> so by location of roots there exists <span>$c \in (a,b)$</span> such that <span>$g(c) = 0$</span>, i.e. <span>$f(c) - k = 0$</span> so <span>$f(c) = k$</span>. If <span>$f(b) &lt; k &lt; f(a)$</span>, the proof follows similarly.</p>
<p><strong>Corollary:</strong> Let <span>$I = [a, b]$</span> be a closed and bounded interval and <span>$f : I \to \mathbb{R}$</span> be a continuous function on <span>$I$</span>. If there exists <span>$k \in \mathbb{R}$</span> such that <span>$\inf f(I) \leq k \leq \sup f(I)$</span> then there exists <span>$c \in I$</span> such that <span>$f(c) = k$</span></p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> Let <span>$m = \inf f(I)$</span> and <span>$M = \sup f(I)$</span>. By a previous theorem, <span>$\exists a_1, b_1$</span> such that <span>$f(a_1) = m$</span> and <span>$f(b_1) = M$</span>. Apply IVT to <span>$[\inf\{a_1, b_1\}, \sup\{a_1, b_1\}]$</span>.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote" title="These inf/sups can be replaced with max/mins, as i...">2</a></sup></p>
<p>What follows from this is the fact that the image of a continuous function on a closed and bounded interval is also closed and bounded.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let <span>$I = [a, b]$</span> be a closed and bounded interval and <span>$f : I \to \mathbb{R}$</span> be a continuous function on <span>$I$</span>. Then <span>$f(I)$</span> is a closed bounded interval </p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> Let <span>$m = \inf f(I)$</span> and <span>$M = \sup f(I)$</span>. Then <span>$f(I) \subseteq [m, M]$</span>. By a previous corollary, if <span>$k \in [m, M]$</span> then there exists a <span>$c \in I$</span> such that <span>$f(c) = k$</span> so <span>$k \in f(I)$</span> so <span>$[m, M] \subseteq f(I)$</span> thus <span>$f(I) = [m, M]$</span>.</p>
