        <p>Let's start off today with a lemma - those useful little building blocks fo proper theorems and their proofs. If you took the exam for Analysis 1, Fall 2012, this will look familiar:</p>
<p><strong>Lemma:</strong> If <span>$g : A \to \mathbb{R}$</span> is continuous at <span>$c \in A$</span> and <span>$g(c) \neq 0$</span>, then there exists a neighborhood of <span>$c$</span> for which <span>$g(x) \neq 0$</span> on that neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> <span>$g(c) \neq 0$</span>, so let <span>$\epsilon = \frac{|g(c)|}{2}$</span>. Since <span>$g$</span> is continuous at <span>$x=c$</span>, <span>$\exists \delta &gt; 0$</span> such that <span>$|x - c| &lt; \delta$</span> implies <span>$|g(x) - g(c)| &lt; \epsilon$</span>. So <span>$|g(c)| - |g(x)| \leq |g(c) - g(x)| &lt; \frac{|g(c)|}{2}$</span>. Rearranging this, we see that <span>$|g(c)| - \frac{|g(c)|}{2} &lt; |g(x)|$</span> thus <span>$0 &lt; \frac{|g(c)|}{2} &lt; |g(x)|$</span>. So in the neighborhood of our <span>$\delta$</span>, <span>$g(x) \neq 0$</span>.</p>
<p>We can also get the following corollary out of this:</p>
<p><strong>Corollary:</strong> If <span>$g : A \to \mathbb{R}$</span> is continuous at <span>$c \in A$</span> and <span>$g(c) \neq 0$</span>, then <span>$1 / g(x)$</span> is continuous at <span>$c$</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> For a given <span>$\epsilon &gt; 0$</span>, there exists a <span>$\delta &gt; 0$</span> such that <span>$|g(x)| &gt; \frac{|g(c)|}{2}$</span> for all <span>$x$</span> in the <span>$\delta$</span>-neighborhood of <span>$c$</span>. Thus, <span>$\frac{2}{|g(c)|} &gt; \frac{1}{|g(x)|}$</span> for those <span>$x$</span>. Thus, by the Triangle Inequality:</p>
<p><span>$$
\left|\frac{2}{|g(x)|}  - \frac{2}{|g(c)|}\right| = \frac{|g(c) - g(x)|}{|g(x)||g(c)|} \leq \frac{2 \cdot |g(x) - g(c)|}{|g(c)|^2}
$$</span></p>
<p>But <span>$g$</span> is continuous at <span>$c$</span>, so for a given <span>$\epsilon &gt; 0$</span>, there exists a <span>$\delta_1 &gt; 0$</span> such that if <span>$|x - c| &lt; \delta_1$</span>, then <span>$|g(x) - g(c)| &lt; \frac{|g(c)|^2}{2}\epsilon$</span>. Thus, if we choose a <span>$\delta_2 := \inf\{\delta, \delta_1\}$</span> and set <span>$|x - c| &lt; \delta_2$</span>, then:</p>
<p><span>$$
\left|\frac{1}{g(x)} - \frac{1}{g(c)}\right| \leq \frac{2 \cdot |g(x) - g(c)|}{|g(c)|^2} &lt; \epsilon
$$</span></p>
<p>Thus completing our proof.</p>
<h2 class="header"><i>1</i>More combinations of continuous functions<a class="headerlink" href="#more-combinations-of-continuous-functions" name="more-combinations-of-continuous-functions">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Now let's talk about functions that are everywhere continuous. It's easy to see that <span>$f(x) = x$</span> is a continuous function, and as we've seen, the product of a continuous function with a scalar or another continuous function is continuous. Additionally, the sum of continuous functions is continuous. Therefore <em>polynomials are continuous everywhere</em> as you can construct them with <span>$f(x) = x$</span> and some coefficients. Rational functions are also continuous everywhere in their domain.</p>
<p>What about the composition of continuous functions? It turns out these are also continuous, which we'll state and prove as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Given <span>$A, B \subseteq \mathbb{R}$</span>, let <span>$f : A \to \mathbb{R}$</span> and <span>$g : B \to \mathbb{R}$</span> be functions where <span>$f(A) \subseteq B$</span>. If <span>$f$</span> is continuous at <span>$c \in A$</span> and <span>$g$</span> is continuous at <span>$f(c)$</span> then <span>$g \circ f : A \to \mathbb{R}$</span> is continuous at <span>$c$</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> <span>$g$</span> is continuous at <span>$b = f(c)$</span>, so for a given <span>$\epsilon &gt; 0$</span>, there exists a <span>$\delta &gt; 0$</span> such that <span>$|g(x) - g(b)| &lt; \epsilon$</span>. <span>$f$</span> is continuous at <span>$c$</span>. Thus there exists a <span>$\delta_1 &gt; 0$</span> such that if <span>$|x - c| &lt; \delta_1$</span> then <span>$|g(f(x)) - g(f(c))| &lt; \epsilon$</span>, thus completing our proof.</p>
<h2 class="header"><i>2</i>Closed, bounded intervals<a class="headerlink" href="#closed-bounded-intervals" name="closed-bounded-intervals">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Now we give a definition that will be useful (and is quite obvious):</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A function <span>$f : A \to \mathbb{R}$</span> is said to be bounded on <span>$A$</span> if there exists some <span>$M &gt; 0$</span> such that <span>$|f(x)| \leq M$</span> for all <span>$x \in A$</span>.</p>
<p>In general, a continuous function on an interval need not be bounded, for example the function <span>$1/x$</span> on <span>$(0,1)$</span>. However, a continuous function on a <em>closed, bounded</em> interval is bounded on that interval:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let <span>$I = [a, b]$</span> be a closed, bounded interval and <span>$f : I \to \mathbb{R}$</span> be a continuous function on <span>$I$</span>. Then <span>$f$</span> is bounded on <span>$I$</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>: Suppose <span>$f$</span> is not bounded. Then for all <span>$M \in \mathbb{N}$</span> there exists some <span>$x_M \in I$</span> such that <span>$|f(x_M)| &gt; M$</span>. Thus, <span>$(x_M)$</span> is a sequence in <span>$I$</span>. But <span>$I$</span> is a closed and bounded interval, so by Bolzano-Weierstrass it has a convergent subsequence <span>$(x_{M_k})$</span> that converges to some <span>$x_0 \in I$</span>. As <span>$f$</span> is continuous on <span>$I$</span>, <span>$f(x_{M_k}) \to f(x_0)$</span>, i.e. <span>$f(x_{M_k})$</span> is convergent and convergent sequences are bounded. Hence we conclude our proof by contradiction.</p>
<p>This is an important result to know as it is used often. And now for another definition:</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Let <span>$A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$</span>, <span>$f : A \to \mathbb{R}$</span>. We say <span>$f$</span> has an <em>absolute maximum</em> on <span>$A$</span> if there exists <span>$c \in A$</span> such that <span>$f(c) \geq f(x)$</span> for all <span>$x \in A$</span>. Similarly, <span>$f$</span> has an absolute minimum on <span>$A$</span> if there exists <span>$d \in A$</span> such that <span>$f(d) \leq f(x)$</span> for all <span>$x \in A$</span>.</p>
<p>This is a pretty intuitive definition and doesn't require much thought. Now let's make use of this new definition in the following theorem:</p>
<p><strong>Theorem:</strong> Let <span>$I = [a, b]$</span> be a closed, bounded interval, and <span>$f : I \to \mathbb{R}$</span> be continuous on <span>$I$</span>. Then <span>$f$</span> achieves both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum on <span>$I$</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> By a previous theorem, we know there exists <span>$M &gt; 0$</span> such that <span>$|f(x)| \leq M$</span>, so <span>$f(x) \leq |f(x)| \leq M$</span> for all <span>$x \in A$</span>. Thus the set <span>$f(I) = \{f(x) : x \in A\}$</span> is bounded above, and therefore has a supremum <span>$S$</span>. Another way or saying this is that for <span>$n \in \mathbb{N}$</span>, <span>$S - 1/n$</span> is not an upper bound. So we can create a sequence <span>$(x_n)$</span> defined such that <span>$S - 1/n &lt; f(x_n) \leq S$</span>. By Bolzano-Weierstrass, there is a convergent subsequence <span>$(x_{n_k})$</span> that converges to some <span>$x_0 \in I$</span>. By the squeeze theorem we know that <span>$f(x_0) = S$</span>, giving us the absolute maximum. The proof for a minimum follows similarly.</p>
