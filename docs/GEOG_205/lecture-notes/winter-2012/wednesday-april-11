        <p>•   Readings: Geo-Engineering – Oxford Companion to Global Change<br />
•   Climate “tech fixes” … - BBC News</p>
<p>The Ecological Footprint<br />
•   Look and see where we can adjust things to make the environment better<br />
•   Carrying Capacity: how many people can the planet support?<br />
•   How many planets do humans need?<br />
•   Everything we need to survive comes from solar energy and things on Earth<br />
•   Closed system, we are not bringing anything in<br />
•   How much land and water do humans need to: Dispose of waste, Survive<br />
•   Footprint can be estimated at multiple scales: global, national, cities, personal<br />
•   Can easily compare across people, cities, and nations<br />
•   Can observe the changes through time<br />
•   Simple concept, easily conveyed to the public</p>
<p>How much land is there?<br />
•   22% of the Earth’s surface is useful and productive<br />
•   4% biologically productive ocean (fisheries)<br />
•   18% biologically productive land (forestry, croplands, grazing)<br />
•   67% non-productive ocean<br />
•   If distributed equally amount 6 billion people: 1.8 global hectares/person (food, energy, all of waste) to be sustainable and not dramatically change the Earth’s systems</p>
<p>How much land do we use?<br />
o   Amount of land for us to live in houses/buildings<br />
o   Wetlands for waste absorption to clean water and landfills<br />
o   Space in the ocean and land to grow food (crops)<br />
o   Building materials and fires<br />
o   Oceans to absorb carbon from burning fossil fuels</p>
<p>What is our footprint?<br />
o   Humanity’s ecological footprint, 1961-2003<br />
o   1963: using 50%<br />
o   1980s: using 100%<br />
o   After 1980, over the biocapacity (over 100%)<br />
o   Can be over 100% because we are using non-renewable resources (carbon)<br />
o   Carbon is absorbed by the environment<br />
o   Many people in the world who do not eat enough and if they did there would not be enough food to go around<br />
o   More built-up and, nuclear energy, fishing ground, forest, grazing land, cropland all mostly the same (amount around the same, used our land more intensely/effectively)<br />
o   But CO2 from fossil fuels has doubled<br />
o   Ecological footprint per person, by country (2003): Most is the United Emerates, USA, Canada, Europian countries</p>
<p>Who are the debters and who are the crediters?<br />
o   Canada: rich in bio-capacity and natural resources<br />
o   All of the non-northern developed countries (excludes Scandinavia, Russia, Canada) <br />
o   Latin America has not exceeded their bio-capacity <br />
o   A lot depends on density <br />
o   Ecological footprint of international trade <br />
o   Figure out your own footprint: <a href="http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/">http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/</a></p>
<p>Priority Actions for Consumers<br />
o   Transportation<br />
o   Food<br />
o   Household operations (air conditioning, lights, ect)<br />
o   Air travel</p>
<p>Earth: The Operators Manual<br />
o   Recap of course material<br />
o   Excellent selection of solutions<br />
o   Exam questions based on film!</p>
<p>Film Notes<br />
o   Climate change + Energy<br />
o   Growing population needs more and more clean energy</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Humans and Energy<br />
o   Began with fire, mostly fossil fuels<br />
o   7 billion, headed to 10 billion<br />
o   Coal, oil, natural gas: 70%<br />
o   Nuclear: 5%<br />
o   Hydro: 6%<br />
o   Solar, wind, geothermal: 1%<br />
o   Wood and dung: 10%<br />
o   1.5 billion without electricity or clean fuels<br />
o   350 million Chinese move from country to city<br />
o   More people will use more energy as they escape from poverty<br />
o   Off the grid: a few hundred watts (a few bulbs), South America: 13, China: 22, Europe: 5000 watts, 50 bulbs, North Americans: 10000 watts, 100 bulbs<br />
o   If everyone started using energy like North American’s do, the world energy use would more than quadruple<br />
o   Burning through fossil fuels more than a billion times faster than they can be made<br />
o   Vary what goes into the Earth’s core and temperature and you get different fossil fuels<br />
o   Few hundred million years to form fossil fuels<br />
o   Reversing the process by which the fossil fuels formed (C + O2 = CO2)<br />
o   US Airforce needed to discover atmosphere for heat seeking missiles<br />
o   Smart missiles couldn’t see very far if they used a wavelength that CO2 absorbed<br />
o   Showed the heat-trapping influence of CO2<br />
o   Didn’t seek out global warming but CO2 turns up the planet’s thermostat<br />
o   Remove CO2, and things cool down<br />
o   Southern Alps: Glaciers (slow-moving rivers of ice sitting on land), used to be liquid water in the sea<br />
o   Brightness of the sun hasn’t changed, orbit changes (obliquity, eccentricity, precession)<br />
o   Changing currents let the oceans absorb CO2 from the air, cooled southern hemisphere and made glaciers<br />
o   Lower CO2, colder temperatures, Franz Joseph advanced<br />
o   Warming and cooling effects of rising and falling levels of CO2 to explain cooling (ice age)<br />
o   Atmosphereic CO2 is increasing, temperature is rising, glaciers are melting (today)</p>
<p>o   Oldest core goes back 400 000 years, reveals earth’s climate history<br />
o   Can count when water turns to ice and can count (summer, winter, summer, winter)<br />
o   Ash of an Icelandic volcano that blew up to Greenland 50 000 years ago<br />
o   Bubbles form as snow turn to ice and trapped old air<br />
o   Cores from Antartica that are even older<br />
o   Tell us how much CO2 was in the air by analyzing gases that come off<br />
o   Pattern of rising and falling temperature along with CO2 levels are very related (180, 280 ppm)<br />
o   Can’t explain large changes in temperature without CO2<br />
o   In just 250 years (since Industrial Revolution) we have blown past 380 ppm, level not seen in more than 400 000 years (40x longer than oldest human civilization)<br />
o   How do we know that it is not just more natural variation? How do we know humans are the source of CO2?<br />
o   Is it because of the volcanoes?  Humans are putting out 50- 100 times more CO2 than the volcanic sources<br />
o   Volcanoes don’t burn or use oxygen, melt rocks <br />
o   Humans burning: rise in CO2 comes with a decrease in oxygen<br />
o   C-12 (plants), C-13 (volcanoes), C-14 (radioactive, decays in 50 000 years, not in dinosaur bones or fossil fuels)<br />
o   See a rise in C-12 so the CO2 is not coming from volcanoes or recently living plants<br />
o   Climate change is certain, but what is it going to be like in specific regions of the world and when???<br />
o   Sea-level rise will be long-term and significant issue in the 21st century</p>
<p>o   USA Army: Energy-Saving Experimental Base<br />
o   Test portable solar power units, purify water to make it drinkable<br />
o   Want to minimize number of convoys using fuel and water<br />
o   Lots of people killed or wounded when bringing supplies<br />
o   The military’s use of renewable energy can save oil<br />
o   This is a culture change, the Military can influence others<br />
o   US Military is the largest energy user in the USA<br />
o   China is the largest energy user on the Planet (population 4x larger)<br />
o   Energy research and incentives for wind, solar, and other clean energy technologies<br />
o   China is throwing spaghetti on a wall<br />
o   Coal is generating over 70% of energy in China, uses more coal than any other nation on Earth</p>
<p>o   Can low-carbon solutions give us enough energy?<br />
o   15.7 terawatts of energy for all humans on the earth (15 700 000 000 000)<br />
o   Can we get to 15.7 terawatts using only renewable energy?<br />
o   Solar powers in the dessert will be 0.01% of the energy we need<br />
o   Sun delivers 173 000 W to top of earth’s atmosphere (11x more than human use)<br />
o   400 mirrors point at tall tower to create steam <br />
o   deserts in southern US have enough energy to provide 80% of the energy for the whole world!<br />
o   NIGHT IS A PROBLEM!!!<br />
o   Transmission and storage currently being developed<br />
o   Rainfall feeds planets rivers, hydro power…water power!!!<br />
o   High voltage direct current transmission lines to minimize energy loss<br />
o   This shows that renewable energy can go the distance!<br />
o   Dams displace people, disrupt landscapes and animals<br />
o   Hydro: 1.9 TW<br />
o   Plantstions harvest cane for harvest of sugar (or corn) and produce ethanol <br />
o   Ethanol made from sugarcane is 7x more efficient than corn<br />
o   Almost all cars sold in brazil use “flex fuels” mix of gasoline and ethanol<br />
o   Using food for fuel raises questions in a hungry world<br />
o   Can biofuels be made from agricultural waste? Yes, we are trying to reduce the costs<br />
o   Biomass: 166 TW<br />
o   New Zealand: geisers and hot springs, geothermal power plants harvest heat and are used for 10% of New Zealand’s energy<br />
o   Geothermal: 44 TW<br />
o   Accessable hot rocks beneath USA contain enough energy to run country for 130 000 years<br />
o   Can provide “peaking power” at a moment’s notice<br />
o   Windmills!!! Texas to the Canadian border (2000 miles) <br />
o   In Texas there is 1600 windmills in one county<br />
o   Windmills helps pay taxes and the feed bill, ranchers and farmers call it mailbox money<br />
o   Each windmill generates <span>$5000-$</span>15000 per year for the farmer<br />
o   Off-shore wind farms<br />
o   Properly cited turbines can minimize problems with birds<br />
o   Efficiency can cut energy by 1/3 by 2030 <br />
o   Next generation nuclear, <br />
o   In 2030: Fossil fuels 13%, renewable 66%, current the rest</p>
