<ol>
<li>Why is oil immersion necessary when viewing a slide using the 100x objective lens? <ul>
<li>(A) Oil has a lower refractive index than air, thus allowing light rays to bend more, so we get a sharper image</li>
<li>(B) Oil has a higher refractive index than air, thus allowing light rays to bend more, so we get a sharper image</li>
<li>(C) Oil has a higher magnification than air, allowing us to achieve 100x magnification</li>
<li>(D) The bottom of the objective lens needs to be in contact with the slide through a medium other than air in order for an image to form at this magnification, and since water is not viscous enough, we use oil</li>
<li>ANSWER: (B). Oil does have a higher refractive index than air, so (A) is incorrect; (C) is wrong because oil doesn't affect the magnification (according to the magnification formula anyway) and (D) is just nonsensical.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which part of the microscope does NOT contribute to the magnification in the formula for total magnification? <ul>
<li>(A) Eyepiece</li>
<li>(B) The objective lens</li>
<li>(C) The condenser lens</li>
<li>(D) The body tube</li>
<li>ANSWER: (C). The magnification formula involves the eyepiece, objective lens, and body tube only.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which of the objective lenses below is not correctly matched to its magnification? <ul>
<li>(A) Scanning objective - 5x</li>
<li>(B) Low power objective - 10x</li>
<li>(C) High power objective - 40x</li>
<li>(D) Oil immersion objective - 100x</li>
<li>ANSWER: (A). The magnification of the scanning objective is 3.2x.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why would you adjust the condenser front lens? <ul>
<li>(A) It does not need to be adjusted during the course of ordinary microscope usage</li>
<li>(B) It needs to be tilted up for the scanning and low-power objectives</li>
<li>(C) It needs to be tilted up for the oil immersion object only</li>
<li>(D) It needs to be tilted up for the low power, high power, and oil immersion objectives</li>
<li>ANSWER: (D). See the lab manual if you disagree.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which of the below gives the correct magnification for a microscope with given stats: eyepiece = 10x, using the scanning objective, with a binocular tube magnification of 10x? <ul>
<li>(A) 100x</li>
<li>(B) 1000x</li>
<li>(C) 320x</li>
<li>(D) 500x</li>
<li>ANSWER: (C) Magnification formula = eyepiece x objective x body/binocular tube = 10 x 3.2 x 10. So 320x.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What's one reason why we typically only use the fine-focus knob for higher (40x, 100x) power objectives? <ul>
<li>(A) If we used the coarse-focus knob, we might break the cover slide</li>
<li>(B) The coarse-focus knob is deactivated on the higher power objectives</li>
<li>(C) The fine-focus knob allows us to better focus the light coming through the front condenser lens, so we get a sharper image in the higher objectives</li>
<li>(D) There is no other knob to use</li>
<li>ANSWER: (A). Although (A) seems less scientific than the others, it's actually the right answer. (C) means nothing, (B) is untrue, and (D) is also untrue except maybe in an existentialist sense.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="header"><i>1.2</i>Plant and animal cells<a class="headerlink" href="#plant-and-animal-cells" name="plant-and-animal-cells">&para;</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>How might you check if the plant cell you are looking at under the microscope is alive or dead? <ul>
<li>(A) Observe the colour - if it's a faded green with dark streaks, it's likely dead</li>
<li>(B) Check for the absence of chloroplasts moving around the cell</li>
<li>(C) Check for the absence of lignified cell walls</li>
<li>(D) Poke it and see if it pokes you back</li>
<li>ANSWER: (B). In living plant cells you should be able to observe cytoplasmic streaming through the movement of chloroplasts around the cell. (A) means nothing. (C) also means nothing - even dead plant cells typically still have cell walls. (D) would be creepy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choose the best description of cytoplasmic streaming in a plant cell and how you might view it <ul>
<li>(A) Cytoplasmic streaming is the presence of cytoplasms in the cell - look for cytoplasms</li>
<li>(B) Cytoplasmic streaming is the directed flow of the cytosol - look for chloroplasts moving around</li>
<li>(C) Cytoplasmic streaming is due to Brownian motion within the cell - add a drop of dye to observe it</li>
<li>(D) Cytoplasmic streaming only occurs in animal cells, not plant cells</li>
<li>ANSWER: (B). (A) no, (C) is a red herring, (D) is patently untrue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why do we draw iodine solution through the leaf? Choose the best answer. <ul>
<li>(A) So we can kill it ... otherwise the leaf will move around, be hard to view</li>
<li>(B) To view pyrenoids (starch-containing bodies) more clearly</li>
<li>(C) To preserve it, prevent damage through oxidation</li>
<li>(D) To stain cell walls, view them more clearly</li>
<li>ANSWER: (B). Iodine selectively stains for starch-containing bodies. (A) is obviously a made-up answer, (C) is a red herring, and iodine does not stain cell walls, as in (D).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which of the following is NOT a difference between animal and plant cells? <ul>
<li>(A) Plant cells have a thick cellulose cell wall; animals have only a thin plasma membrane around their cytoplasm</li>
<li>(B) Plants have chloroplasts; animals do not</li>
<li>(C) Animals have mitochondria; plants do not</li>
<li>(D) While both have vacuoles, plant cells typically have larger vacuoles than do animal cells</li>
<li>ANSWER: (C). Animals and plants both have mitochondria. There was a similar question in the review questions, which I didn't actually realise when I made this; the suggested answer implied that animals don't have vacuoles. This was amended in the review session on March 14 - animals do indeed have vacuoles, they just don't have a central vacuole. tl;dr my answer is right</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the main purpose of staining in the observation of tissues? <ul>
<li>(A) Because we don't want our deposit back</li>
<li>(B) To increase the visibility of specific types of cell structures</li>
<li>(C) To make the cell in general brighter and clearer under the microscope</li>
<li>(D) To kill the plant</li>
<li>ANSWER: (B). Doesn't really need an explanation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which of the cell components below is correctly matched to the stain it is best known for taking up? <ul>
<li>(A) Lignified cell walls - safranin</li>
<li>(B) Starch grains - fast violet</li>
<li>(C) Cellulose cell walls - methyl blue</li>
<li>(D) Chloroplasts - crystal green</li>
<li>ANSWER: (A). Starch grains are stained by crystal violet, not fast violet (A); cellulose cell walls are stained by fast green, not methyl blue (C); and chloroplasts don't really need staining, they're already green.</li>
</ul>

<li>(B) Not showering for a week and spraying nothing on your body</li>
<li>(C) Spraying lots of insect repellent on your body</li>
<li>(D) Spraying both Axe and insect repellent on your body</li>

<li>(B) Baking cookies using lots of sand</li>
<li>(C) Baking cookies using both sand and sugar</li>
<li>(D) Baking cookies using neither sand nor sugar</li>
<li>ANSWER: (D). See the lab summary for lab 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You have set up an experiment to determine if drinking bleach for breakfast is better for you than drinking milk. You have one group of people drinking milk, one group of people drinking bleach, and one group of people drinking nothing. Which of the following best describes the role of the people drinking milk? <ul>
<li>(A) Positive control</li>
<li>(B) Negative control</li>
<li>(C) The experiment</li>
<li>(D) None of the above</li>
<li>ANSWER: (A). The people drinking milk serve as a positive control, to ensure that drinking milk does provide a result.</li>

<ol>
<li>Which of the bacterial species below is NOT correctly matched with its probable shape? <ul>
<li>(A) Staphylococcus aureus - rods</li>
<li>(B) Bacillus subtilis - rods</li>
<li>(C) Streptococcus pneumoniae - little balls</li>
<li>(D) Spirillum volutans - helical rods</li>
<li>ANSWER: (A). Pretty obviously. Cocci = balls, not rods. Don't mind my terminology.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which of the following is the best description of the purpose of Gram staining? <ul>
<li>(A) To make the cell walls of bacteria more visible by staining them a deep purple</li>
<li>(B) To classify bacteria into different categories depending on the thickness of their cell wall</li>
<li>(C) Each distinct specie reacts differently to gram staining, so we can identify species based on their gram stain</li>
<li>(D) There is no purpose to Gram staining</li>
<li>ANSWER: (B). Obviously. (C) is untrue and (A) is too specific to be true.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which of the following is NOT a commonly-used sterile technique for plating bacteria? <ul>
<li>(A) When pipetting, make sure to draw up some of the solution into the pipetting aid</li>
<li>(B) Holding the test tube at a 45 degree angle in the air when removing the lid</li>
<li>(C) Heating the inoculating loop over a flame until red-hot before using it to transfer bacteria</li>
<li>(D) Storing the spreader in ethanol</li>
<li>ANSWER: (A). Make sure you DON'T draw up any o the solution into the pipetting aid.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="header"><i>2.2</i>Bacterial colonies<a class="headerlink" href="#bacterial-colonies" name="bacterial-colonies">&para;</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Which of the following looks like a possible description of <strong>colony</strong> of ''Bacillus subtilis''? <ul>
<li>(A) Small, little balls, yellowish</li>
<li>(B) Large, reddish, rod-shaped, hard-looking</li>
<li>(C) Large, flat, round, yellow-ish</li>
<li>(D) Small, reddish, curved rods, mucoid</li>
<li>ANSWER: (C). It's a description of a colony, as I so helpfully bolded. The others are more descriptions of the actual bacteria under a microscope.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="header"><i>2.3</i>Bacterial morphology<a class="headerlink" href="#bacterial-morphology" name="bacterial-morphology">&para;</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>What is the correct order of the solutions we use in Gram staining? <ul>
<li>(A) Gram's iodine; methyl blue; tap water and ethanol; carbol fuchsin</li>
<li>(B) Gentian violet; gram's iodine; methyl blue; tap water and ethanol</li>
<li>(C) Gram's iodine; tap water and ethanol; gentian violet; carbol fuchsin</li>
<li>(D) Gentian violet; Gram's iodine; tap water and ethanol; carbol fuchsin</li>
<li>ANSWER: (D). Remember it as GV, GI, T/E, CF or something.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium. Let's say you wanted to carry out Gram-staining in such a way as to make it appear gram-negative. How might you accomplish this? <ul>
<li>(A) Omit the carbol fuchsin</li>
<li>(B) Leave it flooded with ethanol for longer than a minute</li>
<li>(C) Squirt it with methyl blue at the end</li>
<li>(D) This is not possible</li>
<li>ANSWER: (B). This is a pretty good question if I do say so myself. Leaving it decolourised for a long enough period of time will cause it to take up the counterstain (carbol fuchsin) and thus appear Gram negative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="header"><i>2.4</i>Bacterial growth<a class="headerlink" href="#bacterial-growth" name="bacterial-growth">&para;</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Which of the following is the best explanation of generation time? <ul>
<li>(A) The rate at which bacteria grow during their exponential phase</li>
<li>(B) The time taken for the number of bacteria to double during lag phase</li>
<li>(C) The time taken for the number of bacteria to double during exponential phase</li>
<li>(D) The time it takes to form one new generation of bacteria during any phase</li>
<li>ANSWER: (C). (A) is not even a time, (B) is a red herring, and (D) seems suspiciously correct but is really not when you think about it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which of the phases below is not well matched with its description? <ul>
<li>(A) Lag phase - cells are adjusting to the new environment, most of them are not dividing yet</li>
<li>(B) Exponential phase - population growing exponentially</li>
<li>(C) Stationary phase - the population numbers stay constant as bacteria are no longer dividing</li>
<li>(D) Death phase - overall population numbers go down</li>
<li>ANSWER: (C). This is a tricky one but during the stationary phase some bacteria may still be dividing - it's just that the overall population numbers remain constant, as other bacteria are dying.</li>

<li>(C) The movement of particles placed in a fluid due to the kinetic energy of the particles of the fluid</li>
<li>(D) The movement of dye particles in a liquid due to the kinetic energy of the dye particles</li>
<li>ANSWER: (C). (A) is a red herring (suspiciously correct, but it's actually the movement of particles placed in the fluid, not the particles of the fluid itself); (B) means nothing; and (D) is too specific and is also incorrect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which of the following is the best description of a dynamic equilibrium? <ul>
<li>(A) There are more particles moving in one direction than other</li>
<li>(B) The rate of movement of particles is the same for both directions</li>
<li>(C) Particles are no longer moving</li>
<li>(D) I'm out of ideas</li>

<li>Which of the following statements about osmosis in living cells is false? <ul>
<li>(A) Plasma membranes of cells have hydrophobic domains</li>
<li>(B) The substance that typically passes through the cell membrane in the greatest quantities is water</li>
<li>(C) The net flow of water is towards the less concentrated solution</li>
<li>(D) Plasma membranes contain pores formed by proteins (aquaporins) to facilitate the movement of water</li>
<li>ANSWER: (C). Accidentally screwed this question up at first. But yeah water moves towards the more concentrated solution. The others are true. I think. Please leave a note on the talk page if something is messed up here.</li>
</ul>

<li>(A) Hypertonic</li>
<li>(B) Hypotonic</li>
<li>(C) Isotonic</li>
<li>(D) This would also never happen, wtf</li>
<li>ANSWER: (B). The cell is hypotonic relative to the solution, as the concentration of solute is lower; water will thus leave the cell to try and get rid of the difference. In a manner of speaking.</li>

<li>Which of the following statements is not true about the penetration of alcohol into beet cells experiment? <ul>
<li>(A) Alcohol that penetrated the cell resulted in the release of the pigment betacyanin</li>
<li>(B) At the higher concentrations, all of the alcohols were able to penetrate the cell</li>
<li>(C) At the lower concentrations, only ethanol was able to penetrate the cell</li>
<li>(D) The longer the carbon chain, the greater the fat solubility and so the greater the penetration</li>

<li>Which of the following statements about Benedict's test is FALSE? <ul>
<li>(A) A solution needs to be heated for about 5 minutes in a 100 C water bath first</li>
<li>(B) The purpose of the test is to check for the presence of reducing sugars; an orange-red colour change indicates a positive result</li>
<li>(C) Any molecules possessing aldehyde or ketone groups will test positive</li>
<li>(D) Glucose, maltose and lactose will all test positive; sucrose will test negative</li>
<li>ANSWER: (C). Tricky, but yeah. (A) is true; (B) is true; (D) is true. (C) is not true because if it were, sucrose would test positive; if "molecules" were to be replaced by "monosaccharides", this statement would be true.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which of the following is a correct explanation of why sucrose will test negative? <ul>
<li>(A) Sucrose consists of beta bonds between its monomers, which cannot be broken down</li>
<li>(B) Sucrose does not contain aldehyde or ketone</li>
<li>(C) The monomers that sucrose is composed of are bonded at their reducing ends, so sucrose cannot be reduced</li>
<li>(D) The glycosidic linkage between sucrose monomers is too strong and cannot be broken down</li>
<li>ANSWER: (C). (A) is a trick answer, and relies on you remembering something about beta bonds (actually applicable to cellulose) but not remembering what they're for; (B) is incorrect; and (D) has nothing to do with it (in fact, the bond CAN be broken down, but then it's not sucrose any more).</li>

<li>(A) Cellulose did not react positively to an iodine test no matter what we did</li>
<li>(B) A positive Benedict's test was always accompanied by a negative iodine test</li>
<li>(C) We had to add sodium hydroxide to neutralise the acid because the iodine test is always negative in acidic conditions</li>
<li>(D) The test tubes with water acted as a control</li>

<li>Which of the following statements about competitive inhibitors is false? <ul>
<li>(A) They usually chemically resemble the enzyme</li>
<li>(B) If we add enough inhibitor, the reaction may not proceed at all</li>
<li>(C) Malonate, the competitive inhibitor we used, cannot be dehydrogenated due to its chemical structure</li>
<li>(D) Competitive inhibitors compete with the natural substrate to bind to the active site on the enzyme</li>
<li>ANSWER: (A). It's the succinate, not the enzyme, that they chemically resemble. The others are true.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which of the following correctly identifies the role of something we used in this experiment? <ul>
<li>(A) Spectrophotometer, to determine the concentration of DCIP (as % transmittance is proportional to the concentration of DCIP)</li>
<li>(B) Azide was used in all the test tubes to provide an oxygen-free environment</li>
<li>(C) Mitochondrial suspension was placed in all the test tubes primarily to provide a substrate that the enzymes could bind to</li>
<li>(D) DCIP was used to catalyse the reaction; the concentration of it indicated how much was left unchanged, and thus how quickly the reaction proceeded</li>
<li>ANSWER: (B). (A) is false because transmittance is NOT proportional to the concentration of DCIP - rather, absorbance, which is obtained logarithmically from the transmittance, is. (C) is false because the mitochondrial suspension was mainly there to provide the enzyme. (D) is just false; DCIP is not a catalsyt afaik.</li>

<li>(A) Glucose and galactose are STRUCTURAL isomers, and although yeast can respire glucose, it lacks the enzyme to convert galactose into glucose</li>
<li>(B) Sodium fluoride acted as an inhibitor, because the sodium binds with magnesium, thus preventing it from acting as a cofactor for the enzyme</li>
<li>(C) Both glucose and galactose can be respired by yeast, but galactose is respired much more slowly because its intermolecular bonds are stronger</li>
<li>(D) We produced a lot of pure ethanol that we later consumed and received alcohol poisoning from</li>
<li>ANSWER: (A). (B) is false because sodium can't bind with magnesium (T_T) - it's the fluoride that does; (C) is false because it's false; and (D) is false because that never happened.</li>

<li>Which of the following incorrectly matches a test tube with its volume change and explanation? <ul>
<li>(A) Only yeast and water - little change, possibly due to residual glucose in the yeast</li>
<li>(B) Yeast and glucose - the largest change, because glucose is easily respired by yeast</li>
<li>(C) Yeast, glucose, and sodium fluoride - little change, because the sodium fluoride inhibited the respiration reaction</li>
<li>(D) Yeast and galactose - a moderate volume change, because galactose is respired more slowly than glucose</li>

<li>Which is false? <ul>
<li>(A) Polytene chromosomes are the result of repeated chromosome replication without subsequent separation</li>
<li>(B) Chromocentre: all four pairs of chromosomes attached by centromeres</li>
<li>(C) Polytene chromosomes have a banded appearance because they are alternatingly extended and coiled</li>
<li>(D) It was important to anaesthesise the larvae after removing their chromosomes so they could be easily replaced.</li>
<li>ANSWER: (D) We kind of had to decapitate them first, so, no.</li>

<ol>
<li>If the probability of finding a &gt;60 amino acid ORF by chance in a random sequence is 1/20, how many such ORFs would you expect to find in a sequence consisting of 300 base pairs? <ul>
<li>(A) 1/20</li>
<li>(B) 5</li>
<li>(C) 15</li>
<li>(D) 20</li>
<li>ANSWER: (B). 300 base pairs = 100 amino acids so an expected value of 5</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Which of the following is false? <ul>
<li>(A) Probability-wise, one is likely to encounter ~20 amino acids before encountering a stop codon just by chance</li>
<li>(B) All genes start with the methionine/start codon (ATG)</li>
<li>(C) An open reading frame ends with a stop codon (TAG etc)</li>
<li>(D) Organisms have only one DNA polymerase</li>
<li>ANSWER: (D). Stupid question. Needs improvement.</li>

<ol>
<li>Which is false? <ul>
<li>(A) The least common class of progeny is usually the result of recombination</li>
<li>(B) When two genes are recombined x% of the time, they are considered x map units and thus x loci apart</li>
<li>(C) Cis arrangement: a+b/a+b; trans arrangement: a+b+/ab</li>
<li>(D) Genes that are closer together on the same chromosome are less likely to be recombined</li>
<li>ANSWER: (C). Other way around.</li>

<ol>
<li>What is the purpose of DNA electrophoresis? <ul>
<li>(A) To stain DNA and make it easier to observe under a microscope</li>
<li>(B) To separate different fragments of DNA by their size for identification purposes</li>
<li>(C) To preserve DNA and prevent it from going bad</li>
<li>(D) To clone DNA into a plasmid</li>

<li>Larger fragments of DNA: <ul>
<li>(A) Get stuck between the comb teeth in the gel</li>
<li>(B) Move more slowly than smaller fragments and so travel the smallest distance</li>
<li>(C) Have more kinetic energy than smaller fragments and so travel the greatest distance</li>

<ol>
<li>Which is false about double recombination blah <ul>
<li>(A) Double recombinants can be identified by finding the two least frequent classes of progeny</li>
<li>(B) Double recombination occurs less frequently than expected (by multiplying frequency of single recombination events) due to interference</li>
<li>(C) Double recombination accounts for the "unexpected" progeny that result from the mating of two homozygous individuals</li>
<li>(D) The distance between the middle gene and one outer gene can be calculated from the frequency of that outer gene switching.</li>
