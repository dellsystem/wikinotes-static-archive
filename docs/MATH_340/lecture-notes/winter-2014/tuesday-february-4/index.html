<h2 class="header"><i>1</i>Planar duals<a class="headerlink" href="#planar-duals" name="planar-duals">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Any planar drawing <span>$G$</span> has a corresponding a <strong>dual</strong> (also planar), which we'll call <span>$H$</span>.</p>
<p>To find the dual: draw the vertices for <span>$H$</span> in the faces of <span>$G$</span>, and connect them if there's an edge between the faces.</p>
<p>Thus <span>$V(H) = F(G)$</span>, <span>$E(H) = E(G)$</span> and <span>$(f_1, f_2) \in E(H) \iff f_1, f_2$</span> are adjacent faces in <span>$G$</span>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the dual of the octahedron is actually the graph of the cube. The dual of the icosahedron is the dodecahedron, and the dual of the tetrahedron is itself (<strong>wow</strong>).</p>
<p>Also, colouring a map is equivalent to colouring the dual of the graph.</p>
<p>Observe that the drawing of the dual graph, <span>$H$</span>, depends on the drawing of <span>$G$</span>. We define the term <span>$k$</span>-connected: a graph <span>$G$</span> is <span>$k$</span>-connected if <span>$\forall u, v, \in V(G)$</span>, there exist at least <span>$k$</span> vertex-disjoint paths between <span>$u$</span> and <span>$v$</span> (i.e., at least <span>$k$</span> different ways of going from <span>$u$</span> to <span>$v$</span>).</p>
<p>We claim that if <span>$G$</span> is 3-connected and planar then it has a unique dual. On the other hand, if a graph is not 3-connected, it may have 2 or more dual graphs, depending on the way we draw the original graph.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><a href=""><img alt="A graph with multiple distinct duals" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Noniso_dual_graphs.svg/200px-Noniso_dual_graphs.svg.png" title="From Wikimedia commons" /></a></p>
<p>We can be certain that these are two different graphs (and not just the same graph drawn in a slightly different way) by looking at the distribution of degrees.</p>
<h3 class="header"><i>1.1</i>Bipartite graphs and Eulerian duals<a class="headerlink" href="#bipartite-graphs-and-eulerian-duals" name="bipartite-graphs-and-eulerian-duals">&para;</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Theorem: <span>$G$</span> is bipartite <span>$\iff$</span> its dual <span>$H$</span> is Eulerian.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proof left as an exercise.</p>
<h3 class="header"><i>1.2</i>Graph minors<a class="headerlink" href="#graph-minors" name="graph-minors">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We say <span>$H$</span> is a minor of <span>$G$</span> if it can be obtained from <span>$G$</span> by applying a sequence of the following operations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Edge deletion: remove an edge <span>$e$</span> (<span>$G-e$</span>)</li>
<li>Vertex deletion: remove a vertex and all of its adjacent edges</li>
<li>Edge contraction: contract an edge <span>$e=(i, j)$</span> by combining <span>$i$</span> and <span>$j$</span> and removing loops and multiple edges (<span>$G/e$</span>).</li>
</ol>
<p>If <span>$H$</span> is a minor of <span>$G$</span> we write <span>$H \preccurlyeq G$</span>. The minor property is transitive.</p>
<p>Suppose we're given a particular graph <span>$H$</span> and we're trying to see if we can find it as as minor in <span>$G$</span>. The way to do this is to look for trees in <span>$G$</span> that correspond to the vertices of <span>$H$</span>, and then just contract the trees. Note that they have to be <em>trees</em>, and not <em>cycles</em>; contracting cycles doesn't give you anything you couldn't get by contracting a tree.</p>
<h4 class="header"><i>1.2.1</i>Kuratowski's theorem<a class="headerlink" href="#kuratowskis-theorem" name="kuratowskis-theorem">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Here's why minors are useful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Theorem: <span>$G$</span> is planar <span>$\iff$</span> <span>$G$</span> does not contain a <span>$K_5$</span> minor or a <span>$K_{3,3}$</span> minor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proof: By Euler's formula, if <span>$G$</span> contains a <span>$K_{3,3}$</span> or <span>$K_5$</span> subgraph, then it is clearly not planar. Similarly, if they're contained as minors, then <span>$G$</span> can't be planar either - for example, if <span>$K_5$</span> is present as a minor, then <span>$G$</span> has 5 trees, all of which are completely connected. (It seems obvious from this that <span>$G$</span> is therefore not planar, but I'm not sure how to formalise that.)</p>
<p>Suppose, instead, that <span>$G$</span> has neither a <span>$K_5$</span> minor nor a <span>$K_{3,3}$</span> minor. How can we show that <span>$G$</span> is planar? (Note: this is probably one of the hardest theorems in the course.) We can prove this as follows: suppose the theorem is false. In that case, there must be at least one counterexample. Consider the smallest counterexample <span>$G$</span> (so the smallest graph <span>$G$</span> which has neither a <span>$K_5$</span> nor a <span>$K_{3,3}$</span> as a minor and yet is not planar). This will be a proof by contradiction, making use of the fact that any smaller graph is <em>not</em> a counterexample.</p>
<p>Take an arbitrary edge <span>$e = (u, v)$</span> in <span>$G$</span>, and contract it to produce <span>$G' = G\setminus e$</span>. The resulting graph <span>$G'$</span> is planar, since it has no <span>$K_{5}$</span> or <span>$K_{3,3}$</span> minor (by transitivity) and is smaller than <span>$G$</span> (otherwise, it would contradict the fact that <span>$G$</span> is the smallest counterexample).</p>
<p>Now let's add back <span>$e$</span> to <span>$G'$</span>, which will give us a graph that is equivalent to the original <span>$G$</span>. We'll now show that the resulting graph <span>$G$</span> is planar.</p>
<p>First, we show that <span>$G$</span> is 4-connected. To do so, take any planar drawing of <span>$G'$</span>. Look at the face <span>$F$</span> containing the contracted supernode <span>$(u, v)$</span>. I don't really understand the rest of this proof, so fuck it.</p>
<h3 class="header"><i>1.3</i>The Hadwiger conjecture<a class="headerlink" href="#the-hadwiger-conjecture" name="the-hadwiger-conjecture">&para;</a></h3>
<p><span>$$\chi(G) \geq t \; \implies K_t \preccurlyeq G$$</span></p>
<p>So if I need <span>$t$</span> colours to colour graph <span>$G$</span>, then <span>$G$</span> contains a clique of size <span>$t$</span> as a minor.</p>
<p>Remains an open problem. For <span>$k=5$</span>, this implies the four colour theorem, which is kind of neat.</p>
