<p>This is a functionally complete connective, if that's a term, meaning that you can define every other connective using just this one.</p>
<h2 class="header"><i>2</i>The basics of relations<a class="headerlink" href="#the-basics-of-relations" name="the-basics-of-relations">&para;</a></h2>
<p>We start with some basic set notation. Let <span>$A$</span> and <span>$B$</span> be sets (possibly different, possibly the same). <span>$A \times B = \{ (a, b) : a \in A, \, b\in B\}$</span>. For example, <span>$\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} = \mathbb{R}^2$</span> which is 2-dimensional Euclidean space and which consists of all points <span>$(x, y)$</span> ... well, yeah. Anyways.</p>
<p>A relation <span>$R$</span> from <span>$A$</span> to <span>$B$</span> is just a subset of <span>$A\times B$</span>. As <span>$R \subseteq A \times B$</span>, we can write <span>$aRb$</span> (where R means, "is related to") for <span>$(a, b) \in R$</span>.</p>
<p>We have <span>$&lt; \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$</span> so technically <span>$(1, 2) \in &lt;$</span> since we have <span>$1 &lt; 2$</span>.</p>
<p>The domain of <span>$R$</span> is <span>$\{ a \in A: aRb \text{ for some } b \in B\}$</span> (i.e. the set of all things that are, in the first place, related to something<sup>huh?</sup>). The range is <span>$\{ b \in B: aRb \text{ for some } a \in A\}$</span>. Note that you can't figure out the specific intended domain/range<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote" title="Also known or codomain, or image. Not really relev...">2</a></sup> just from the relation itself, as there are many possibilities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>N.B. if <span>$R$</span> is a relation from <span>$A$</span> to <span>$B$</span> (note: not symmetric) and <span>$A \subseteq A'$</span> and <span>$B \subseteq B'$</span>, then the same <span>$R$</span> is also a relation from <span>$A'$</span> to <span>$B'$</span>. This is a convention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case where <span>$A = B$</span> (i.e. <span>$R \subseteq A \times A$</span>), we say <span>$R$</span> is a (binary) <em>relation on</em> <span>$A$</span>.</p>
<h3 class="header"><i>2.1</i>Relations as functions<a class="headerlink" href="#relations-as-functions" name="relations-as-functions">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A relation <span>$R: A \to B$</span> is a function from <span>$A$</span> to <span>$B$</span> if, for each <span>$a \in A$</span>, there is a unique <span>$b \in B$</span> such that <span>$aRb$</span> (although several <span>$a$</span>'s can be related to the same <span>$b$</span>). The domain of the function is all of <span>$A$</span> and the range is a subset<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote" title="Not necessarily a proper subset; it could be all o...">3</a></sup> of <span>$B$</span>. For example, if <span>$A = B = \mathbb{R}$</span> and <span>$R = \{ (x, x^2) : x \in \mathbb{R} \}$</span>, then the domain is <span>$\mathbb{R}$</span>, and the range is only the positive real numbers.</p>
<h4 class="header"><i>2.1.1</i>Injective function<a class="headerlink" href="#injective-function" name="injective-function">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A function from <span>$A$</span> to <span>$B$</span> is <strong>injective</strong> if, whenever <span>$a \neq a'$</span> in <span>$A$</span>, then <span>$f(a) \neq f(a')$</span> - meaning everything in the domain maps to something unique. Such a function is considered one-to-one.</p>
<h4 class="header"><i>2.1.2</i>Surjective functions<a class="headerlink" href="#surjective-functions" name="surjective-functions">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A function is <strong>surjective</strong> if there is at least one <span>$a \in A$</span> such that <span>$f(a) = b$</span> for every <span>$b \in B$</span>. In other words, everything in <span>$B$</span> is accounted for. Also known as "onto"<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote" title="Note that every function is clearly onto its own r...">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Although injectiveness is an intrinsic property, surjectiveness is not, as you can only say that a function is onto <em>something</em>.</p>
<h4 class="header"><i>2.1.3</i>Bijective functions<a class="headerlink" href="#bijective-functions" name="bijective-functions">&para;</a></h4>
<p>A function that is both injective and surjective is bijective. So there is a one-to-one correspondence or perfect matching of <span>$A$</span> and <span>$B$</span>. The notation for this is <span>$A \sim B$</span>, but we won't be using it much. Obviously any one-to-one function is a bijection onto its own range. Beyond that, we have that if <span>$A$</span> is finite, and <span>$A \sim B$</span>, then <span>$A$</span> and <span>$B$</span> have the same number of elements (same cardinality<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote" title="The notion of cardinality is much more complex for...">5</a></sup>, i.e. equinumerous)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fact: <span>$\mathbb{N} \sim \mathbb{Z} \sim \mathbb{Q}$</span> but <span>$\mathbb{N} \nsim \mathbb{R}$</span> because they're infinite<sup>wat</sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Example: <span>$A \sim A$</span> for all <span>$A$</span>: <span>$\iota_A$</span><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote" title="The identity function. There's not much more to it...">6</a></sup>: <span>$\{ (a, a): a \in A \}$</span> is a bijection</p>
<h4 class="header"><i>2.1.4</i>Inverse relations<a class="headerlink" href="#inverse-relations" name="inverse-relations">&para;</a></h4>
<p>If <span>$R \subseteq A \times B$</span>, then inverse of <span>$R$</span>, denoted <span>$R^{-1}$</span>, is <span>$\{ (b, a): a Rb\}$</span>. The inverse of a function is not always a function (although it is always a relation) - it's only a function if the original function is a bijection. If that is true, then the inverse is also a bijection, i.e. <span>$A \sim B \iff B \sim A$</span>.</p>
<h4 class="header"><i>2.1.5</i>Composition of relations<a class="headerlink" href="#composition-of-relations" name="composition-of-relations">&para;</a></h4>
<p>If <span>$R \subseteq A \times B$</span> and <span>$S \subseteq B \times C$</span>, then the composition <span>$S \circ R$</span><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote" title="Function composition goes right-to-left, as per Eu...">7</a></sup> <span>$= R \times S = \{ (a, c) \text{ for some } b \in B, aRb \text{ and } bSc \}$</span>.</p>
<p>Functionally speaking, <span>$f: A \to B$</span>, <span>$g: B \to C$</span>, so <span>$g \circ f: A \to C$</span>. The chain rule in differentiation is an example of this or something.</p>
<p>For example: say <span>$A = B = C$</span> are all sets, of people, and <span>$R=S$</span>. <span>$aRb$</span> means that <span>$a$</span> is the parent of <span>$b$</span>. So when is <span>$a(R \times R)c$</span> true? When <span>$a$</span> is a grandparent of <span>$c$</span> I guess.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fact: If <span>$f: A \to B$</span> and <span>$g: B \to C$</span> are both bijections, so is <span>$g \circ f$</span>. Same with injections and surjections. Hence if <span>$A \sim B$</span> and <span>$B \sim C$</span>, then <span>$A \sim C$</span>.</p>
