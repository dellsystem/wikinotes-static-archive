<p>Beowulf</p>
<p>Themes of civilized ties between people, focused in Heorot, a culture centre<br />
Grendel, springs from Cain, and symbolic of kinship and bonds</p>
<p>Beowulf has analogies with the life of Christ, and it uses an amount of religious symbolism<br />
Common for renassance literature to have an analogy between the hero and Christ. Heroic paradigms are often aligned with Christ</p>
<p>Can Beowulf be comparable to Christ? He always falls short of being human, but he makes an effort trying to do so.</p>
<p>Role of Grendel's mother, kinship ties, lineage.<br />
Emphasis on Cain and his actions, and an emphasis on kinship and the betrayal of kinship ties, epitomizes the violation of kinship ties in general.</p>
<p>Grendel and his mother are described as aliens to culture, symbolizes the forces that threaten culture.</p>
<p>Beowulf's success depends on the sword he picks up at the lair. Consider the symbolizzzzzzzzzzzzm</p>
<p>It's so huge and heavy<sub>that's what she said</sub> that only Beowulf can hold it. He says that the Lord of men allowed him to wield this sword, which was originally made for giants. Implies divine involvement</p>
<p>The hilt of the sword is engraved with the motifs of the judgement of divined giants. Implies divine aid and divine judgement. Divine judgement of giants &lt;&gt; Beowulf's slaying of Grendel's mother</p>
<p>The initiative and decisiveness of the hero himself is needed in addition of the divine intervention</p>
<p>Symbolic purification of the danish land that happens through the slaying of grendel and grendel's mom</p>
<p>Hrothgar has a speech which reveals his views on kinship and human relationships. He's looking back on his life and extracts a philosophy out of it.<br />
He says it's a kind of pattern for leader and kings, a paradigm for humanity. He tells beowulf that it will be his fate too.</p>
<p>What's the relationship between the speech and the story of grendel?</p>
<p>Grendel being greedy as fuck, killing people for brunch, then comes beowulf who subsequently owns him =&gt; analogous to hrothgar. Hrothgar advises beowulf that he might get too prideful </p>
<p>Being prideful is kinda bad, devious desires and impulses will make you do naughty things, like fuck over your constituents as king.</p>
<p>Grendel is an analogy to what could happen within one's self, as one becomes prideful.</p>
<p>Grendel and his mommy is a symbolic expression of psychological threats(psychomachia)</p>
<p>Hrothgar uses the sleep metaphor(Grendel attacks when people are sleeping), sleeping -&gt; being insensitive to surroundings and what's going on. (DON'T SLEEP)<br />
How credible is hrothgar? his speech foreshadows the fate of beowulf, gives credibility to his words. presented as a wise and old king, he also helps others, like beowulf's dad. </p>
<p>Final episode: Beowulf vs Dragon</p>
<p>what analogies are there between beowulf and hrothy?</p>
<p>They're both kings, loved by people, swimming in bitches. They're both faced with a dire threat.</p>
<p>back to the dragon:<br />
beowulf is now aging, and facing the end of his days. even beowulf faces his final limits.</p>
<p>How does this combat proceed in which it relates to the advancement of humanity and kinship ties?</p>
<ul>
<li>Beowulf's followers run away, except for one</li>
<li>beowulf and that dude now fight the dragon</li>
<li>beowulf finds himself getting owned</li>
<li>mainly because he was too prideful and wanted to fight alone, so now he needs to work together with that random dude</li>
<li>dragon's treasure symbolizes wealth, and the thief symbolizes avaricious desire and appetite</li>
<li>the dragon is obviously pissed, and wants his shit back</li>
<li>now the thief is condemned because the dragon is being pissed. Symbolizes the condemnation of avaricious desire and greed</li>
<li>they now recognize that the treasure is a curse, and stealing it might not have been the best idea</li>
<li>what the fuck is going on with the fight with the dragon</li>
<li>something about the people of Geats being greedy fucks</li>
</ul>
