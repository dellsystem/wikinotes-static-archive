<li>allostatic load: consequences of chronic exposure to fluctuating or heightened neural or neuroendocrine response that results from repeated or chronic stress, leading to 4 possible conditions: <ul>
<li>normal response repeated over time</li>
<li>lack of adaptation : (normally response show go down after a number of exposure to the same type of stress</li>
<li>prolonged response: recovery time takes too long</li>

<ul>
<li>under chronic stress, tonically elevated plasma corticosteroids recruit additional neuronal structures (PVthalamus, amygdala, BNSt, locus coeruleus, etc) that project to PVN. </li>
<li>chronic stress also lead to loss of circadian rhythm: <ul>
<li>at mild stress level, only the lowest GC level in the rhythm is increased </li>
<li>at high stress level, the whole curve of cortisol level shift up and rhythm is lost. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>chronic stress leads to higher sensitivity to stress<ul>
<li>rats after some habitual stress stimulus, when exposed to a second/novel stress stimulus, has much higher ACTH level than rats that have not have habitual stress stimulus. <ul>
<li>this effect is more strongly manifested in young rats. because brains are more adaptive when they're young.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>3</i>Effects of Chronic Stress<a class="headerlink" href="#effects-of-chronic-stress" name="effects-of-chronic-stress">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>increase adrenal weight, decrease body weight (not always), increase plasma CORT (corticosterol) level, thymic weight stays about the same. </li>
<li>hippocampus: dendritic atrophy and decrease GR expression (an effort to compensate elevated level of GC) --&gt;decrease HPA feedback and memory</li>
<li>medial prefrontal cortex: same as hippocampus </li>
<li>central amygdala : amygdala enalarges and increase CRH release --&gt; increased HPA and autonomic excitability and anxiety.</li>
<li>thalamus PVN : increase stress excitability --&gt; increased HPA excitability to novel stress and decreased HPA excitability to familiar stress (as discussed earlier)</li>
<li>hypothalamus PVN: upregulate secretagogue synthesis, stress responsivenss, decrease GR expression --&gt; increase excitability to novel stress. </li>
<li>since projection to prefrontal cortex is the last one to mature in adultlescent, exposure to stress during development can impair adaptation to homotypic stress later on. </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>3.1</i>Mechanism of damage caused by chronic stress<a class="headerlink" href="#mechanism-of-damage-caused-by-chronic-stress" name="mechanism-of-damage-caused-by-chronic-stress">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>elevated level of GC occupies GR, which induces apoptosis and exert an inhibitory effect on neurogenesis<ul>
<li>activation of tumor suppressor protein p53, which suppresses Bcl2, an anti-apoptotic molecule<ul>
<li>more proapoptosis molecules than anti-apoptotic molelcules</li>
<li>perturbation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and release of cytochrome c<ul>
<li>activation of caspase 9 (intrinsic pathway of apoptosis)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>extrinsic pathway of apoptosis: byGR recruits FADD which recruits caspase 8, which activates caspse 3, which activates Bid, which stimulates release of cytochrome c release</li>
<li>both intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of apoptosis converges on caspase 3. </li>
<li>induce cell cycle arrest </li>
<li>decrease expression of BDNF (brain-derived neutrophic factor), which activates CREB</li>
<li>GC action via MR can inhibit apoptosis. </li>
<li>there's a fine balance between MR and GC regulation. </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>3.2</i>chronic stress and gene-expression<a class="headerlink" href="#chronic-stress-and-gene-expression" name="chronic-stress-and-gene-expression">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>chronic sress leads to :  <ul>
<li>downregulation of MR and GR --&gt; less effective negative feedback</li>
<li>CA3 dendritic tree atrophy</li>
<li>serotonin receptor downregulation</li>
<li>LTP (long term potentiation) is reduced --&gt; cognitive impairment. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>this is done by epigenic change <ul>
<li>potentially reversible</li>
<li>DNA methylation -- &gt;silence the gene</li>
<li>histone modification at N-terminal tails</li>
<li>regulation by no-coding RNA (microRNA) </li>
<li>environmental influences on gene expression via epigenetic changes can persist even when initial trigger is gone. </li>
<li>inter-individual variability can be due to epigenetic variation and genetic sequence polymorphism, which contribute to vulnerability to diseases. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>example of mice:  <ul>
<li>mice whose moms licked them a lot while they were pups have more resistance to stress <ul>
<li>they have less methylation on GR (more expression of GR)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>wherease mice whose moms didn't licked them much cannot cope with stress as well</li>
<li>cross-fostering (licky-mom pups raised by non-licky moms) : show that offsprings raised by low-licky moms have more methylation on GR <ul>
<li>epigenetic changes! </li>

</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>4</i>Stress and depression<a class="headerlink" href="#stress-and-depression" name="stress-and-depression">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>depression is characterized by high central CRF activity and HPA axis activation <ul>
<li>elevated cortisol</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CRF-R2: anxiety   and CRF-R1: depression</li>
<li>antidepressant normalize HPA function </li>
<li>polymorphisms of GR might be predisposing factors <ul>
<li>short nucleotide polymorphism in MR and GR <ul>
<li>R23K : low cortisol response to TSST (trier social stress test). condition is similar to PBSP </li>
<li>Bell : hyperreactivity to stress due to poor negative feedback regulation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>early life stress and depression can modify HPA axis in the long term:    <ul>
<li>people who were abused as children and/or had major depressive disorder have elevated ACTH and cortisol level. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>4.1</i>Evaluation of negative feedback in HPA axis<a class="headerlink" href="#evaluation-of-negative-feedback-in-hpa-axis" name="evaluation-of-negative-feedback-in-hpa-axis">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>patients receive an oral dose of DEX (synthetic glucocoritcoid) at 11pm before the simulation<ul>
<li>11pm because that's the trough of cortisol level, where HPA should be most sensitive</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>basal blood sample is drawn at 3pm the next day.</li>
<li>CRH is then injected intravenously after 3pm and blood sample is collected at various time after. </li>
<li>plasma ACTH and cortisol are measured</li>
<li>result: <ul>
<li>depressive patients have little negative feedback --&gt; still high cortisol after DEX</li>
<li>depressive patients with hyperactive HPA axis and impaired glucocorticoid feedback have exaggerated ACTH response to CRH injection. </li>
<li>some depressive patients have lower cortisol and ACTH levels when given antidepressant, but for some antidepressants don't work. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>basically<ul>
<li>DEX is used to bring down cortisol level first (to the lowest level) and to see how good the negative feedback is. </li>
<li>and then CRH is used to see how sensitive HPA axis is </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>4.2</i>Activity of HPA axis in depression<a class="headerlink" href="#activity-of-hpa-axis-in-depression" name="activity-of-hpa-axis-in-depression">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>CRH binds CRH-R and induces anxiety, psychomotor activity, anorexia (a eating disorder), sleep disturbance<ul>
<li>drug target CRH1R because it has to do with depression. or CRH2R for anxiety. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>vasopressin is also elevated during stress response and induces anxiety and enforces stress reaction<ul>
<li>bind V1_A and V1_B receptors. not good for drug targets cuz vasopression also does other things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>cortisol : cognitive disturbance, psychotic, affective syndromes, metabolic syndrome, suppressed neurogenesis<ul>
<li>glucocoritocid receptor antagonist as drug, but not reallly good because GC is also important to other normal fnctions and GR is everywhere in the body. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>stress inhibits BDNF (a growth factor, brain-derived neuorotrophic factor) which is supposed to increase serotonin release. so stress leads to depression (possibly)</li>
<li>CRF pathways: <ul>
<li>classical PKA acitvation and increase in cAMP and CREB after binding to CRFR1<ul>
<li>in central amydala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cortex</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ERK pathway <ul>
<li>in basal lateral, laterla amygdala, pparamedial cells (CA1, CA3) </li>
<li>mediates synaptic plasiticity, LTP in the amygdala</li>
<li>mediates proliferation and neuronal differentiation and effects of neurotrophins and growth factors</li>
<li>mediates actionof mood stabilizers in CNS (also used to treat depression) </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>5</i>Antidepression drugs#<a class="headerlink" href="#antidepression-drugs" name="antidepression-drugs">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>how antidepressant drug can work: </p>
<ul>
<li>enhance translocation fo GR receptor into the nucleus --&gt; induces more negative feedback</li>
<li>stimulation of production fo transcription factors (like CREB, NGFIA) that would bind to GRE to induces transcription of some genes (like GR, so more GR to bind GC) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>a novel therapy : deep brain stimulation</p>
<ul>
<li>deep brain stimualtion at nucleus accumbens, cortex, etc, can enhance production of BDNF from neurons with terminals at those region<ul>
<li>alleviate depression</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>transmagnetic stimulation for resistance depression may increase neurogenesis, more dendrites.</li>
<li>mechanisms not well understood. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>future prospect of antidepressants: <ul>
<li>increase serotonin (5-HT) release</li>
<li>increase BDNF and others for cellular plasticity (because depression is associated with decrease in plasicity and neurogenesis)</li>
<li>antagonist of CRF-R1 that can cross the blood brain barrier and resist degradation (because small peptides get degraded readily)</li>
<li>small cell permeable inhibitor of MAPK in conjunction with CRF antagonist to confer regional specificity </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>target to CRF2R can reduce anxiety <ul>
<li>and we know that UCN3 binds specificaly to CRF-R2 and has higher affinity than CRF. </li>
<li>UCN3 is an agonist of CRF-2R and can reduces anxiety. <ul>
<li>evident in mice in maze experiment </li>
<li>UCN3 adminstered mice spend more time in open arm (light) than close arm (dark). less anxious about exploring the maze</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>6</i>Stress, Obesity, Cardiovascular Diseases#<a class="headerlink" href="#stress-obesity-cardiovascular-diseases" name="stress-obesity-cardiovascular-diseases">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>high GC corresponds to catabolic state in acute response</li>
<li>however, in chronic stress, high GC level promotes energy storage, which leads to obesity<ul>
<li>white adipose tissue than produce more GC --&gt; fatter :( </li>
<li>ADX animals (adrenal actomized) loss weigh</li>
<li>it's cuz stress makes the body think that we need more food to meet metabolic demand (since GC is catabolic) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>fat cells have :  <ul>
<li>P450 aromatase <ul>
<li>converts testosterone to estradiol, androstenedione to estrone </li>
<li>mass of adipose tissue correlates closely to whole body steroid level<ul>
<li>up to 100% estrogen and 50% testosterone in postmenopausal women are contributed by adipose tissue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>11b-HSD1 in white adipose tissue <ul>
<li>converts inactive costerone to active glucocorticoids. thus contribute to pool of GC in the body. </li>
<li>positve feedback cycle : chronic stress--&gt;adrenal makes GC --&gt; eat more --&gt; more fat --&gt; more GC </li>
<li>11bHSD1 null mice resist cognitive decline with aging. </li>
<li>important drug target </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>high 11bHSD level can lead to hypertension <ul>
<li>via renin-angiotensin system activation </li>
<li>cardiovascular disease </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>so in summary, glucocorticoid elvels cause obesity, diabetes, heart disease, mood disorder, memory impairment, etc</li>
