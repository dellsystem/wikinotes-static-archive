<li>weight about 15g</li>
<li>left and right lobes are connected by isthmus</li>
<li>congential hypothyroism: sometimes due to thyroid remains attach to tongue.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>1.2</i>Thyroid Hormones<a class="headerlink" href="#thyroid-hormones" name="thyroid-hormones">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>general structure: 2 benzene rings linked by ester bond. paraposition of outer ring is a hydroxyl group and paraposition of the inner ring is a alanine group. </li>
<li>iodine at 5 position (C5 at inner ring) is vital for biological activity of thyroid hormone. </li>
<li><span>$T_4$</span>: 3,5,3'5' tetraiodothyronine , thyroxine : has four iodine, two on each rings</li>
<li><span>$T_3$</span>: 3,5,3' triodothyronine</li>
<li>reverse <span>$T_3$</span>: doesn't have iodine at C5, so inactive. synthesized at hyperthyroism? </li>
</ul>
<h4 class="header"><i>1.2.1</i>Production<a class="headerlink" href="#production" name="production">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>produced in thyrocyte and stored in follicles</li>
<li>Follicles have cavities surrounded by epithelial cells.</li>
<li>that cavities are filled w/ colloids which are made of thyroglobulin</li>
<li>thyroglobulin (Tg) are 330000 MW glycoprotein as a large monomer</li>
<li>Tg also exist as dimer and polymerse, but dimers are more important. </li>
<li>though huge, not particular rich in tyrosine. </li>
<li>It's the spacial distribution of thyrosines creates hormonogenic sites (i.e sites of production). <br />
 -- tyrosine residue (MIT and DIT) are spatially very close to each other<br />
 -- this allow thyroid peroxidase, in presence of <span>$H_2O_2$</span>, to bring the coupling (oxidation )of the 2 thyroxine residues together. </li>
</ul>
<h4 class="header"><i>1.2.2</i>Biosynthesis and Secretion (Production in more details)<a class="headerlink" href="#biosynthesis-and-secretion-production-in-more-details" name="biosynthesis-and-secretion-production-in-more-details">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>On the basal surface of a thyroid cell there's NIS, a I-/Na+ symporter<br />
 -- it concentrates I against gradient, energy comes from Na/K ATPase, pumping Na+ in drags I- in. <br />
  -- I- in side the cell is 200 times that outside the cell </li>
<li>I- is toxic so it's oxydized to <span>$I_2$</span> </li>
<li><span>$I_2$</span> is incorporated into Tg, whose post translational modificatino includes glycosylation, dimerization, etc, before being dumped into the colloid. <br />
 --<span>$I^-$</span> can also be dumped into the colloid via pendrin, a tranporter at the apical surface</li>
<li>thyroid synthesis: Tg is endocytosed by the cell and broken down by lysosome: <br />
 -- <span>$T_4$</span> and <span>$T_3$</span> are released in the cells and send to the extracellular compartment <br />
 -- MIT and DIT are recycled by enzymes which remove iodine from them. </li>
<li>btw, MIT + DIT = 1 <span>$T_3$</span> and 2 X DIT = 1 <span>$T_4$</span>  </li>
<li>also, Tg is a large reservoir, storing I and thyroid hormones and is effective for 4~ 6 weeks<br />
 -- durgs that given to reduce hyperthyrodism don't take effect until after 4-6 weeks.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>1.3</i>Roles of Thyroid Hormones<a class="headerlink" href="#roles-of-thyroid-hormones" name="roles-of-thyroid-hormones">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Growth and development and some specific functions in all vertebrae. </li>
<li>For homeothermic species (warm-blooded animals): thermogenesis and ancillary metabolic effects</li>
<li>Hormonal effects depend on the concentration in or around the cells <br />
 -- Increase in plasma concentration also increases effect. </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>2</i>Hypothalamic Pituitary Thyroid Axis<a class="headerlink" href="#hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid-axis" name="hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid-axis">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In short: TRH (hypothalamus) --&gt; TSH (anterior pituitary) --&gt; <span>$T_4$</span> and <span>$T_3$</span> (thyroid)</li>
<li>Paraventircular nucleus secretes TRH which induces secretion of TSH in the anterior pituitary. </li>
<li>Thyrotropes in anterior pituitary produces TSH which induces thyroid secretion in the thyroid.</li>
<li><span>$T_4$</span> and <span>$T_3$</span> negative feedback onto production of TRH and TSH on hypothalamus and ant. pituitary, respectively. <br />
 -- on TSH synthesis, processing (post-translational event) , etc </li>

<ul>
<li>Normally <span>$T_4$</span> and <span>$T_3$</span> are high in plasma which correspond to low TSH. (physiological concentration)</li>
<li>high TSH happens when there's hypothyroism. </li>
<li>thyrotropes have a much greater secretory capacity than we normally observed. </li>
<li>produced in ant. pituitary by basophilic cells (thyrotropes) </li>
</ul>
<h4 class="header"><i>2.1.1</i>Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#structure" name="structure">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>a glycoprotein, just like FSH, LH, and CG. </li>
<li>subunits: <br />
 -- alpha unit: common to all those 4 glycoproteins<br />
 -- beta : different for each glycoproteins. site of receptor recognition. also the target of immuno essay.\
 -- CHO moitie (carbohydrate) is important for biological activity and half life (makes the half life shorter) </li>
<li>signaling: <br />
 -- Gs: adenyl cyclase, PKA (major)<br />
 -- Gq/11: phospholipase C, PKC (minor<br />
 -- Cross-talking between signaling pathways. </li>
<li>bovine TSH's two oligosaccharides are both sulfated </li>
<li>In human, TSH has two different oligosaccharde chains: sulfated (SO4) and NeuAc <br />
 -- rhTSH: a recombinant human TSH, both chains are NeuAc --&gt; prolong the halfh life so enlongate biological activity. </li>
</ul>
<h4 class="header"><i>2.1.2</i>Circadian rhythm<a class="headerlink" href="#circadian-rhythm" name="circadian-rhythm">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Pulsatile </li>
<li>high at night and early in the morning </li>
<li>no difference between men and women</li>
<li>However, older women display more robust TSH secretion than younger women. <br />
 -- Doesn't happen in men. </li>
<li>What makes the diural pattern? Experiment in rodents show: <br />
 -- corticosterone has no effect on TSH's rhythm. <br />
 -- ablation of suprachiasmatic nucleus (site of biological clock) abolishes the rhythm. <br />
 -- so SON is responsible for TSh's circadian pattern. but it's also due to differnetial expression of Type 2 DIOD-2 (will be discussed later) </li>
</ul>
<h4 class="header"><i>2.1.3</i>Effects on the thyroid glands<a class="headerlink" href="#effects-on-the-thyroid-glands" name="effects-on-the-thyroid-glands">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Earliest effect is on the released of thyroid hormones (ready-made) by stimulating <br />
 --Tg endocytosis<br />
 --Digestion and release of iodoaminoacids<br />
 -- intrathyroidal deiodination of iodotyrosines (MIT and DIT) </li>
<li>stimulate synthesis of thyroid hormones <br />
 -- NIS (the transporter) level and activity <br />
 -- I- oxidation and organification <br />
 -- Coupling of iodotyrosines (MIT and DIT) <br />
 -- Tg synthesis and processing <br />
 -- Deiodination (by D1)</li>
<li>thyroid cell replication and differentiation <br />
 -- therefore it's responsible for goiter (enlargement of thyroid)</li>
<li>It however does  NOT increase expression/activity of pendrin (that transporter on the apical surface）</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>2.2</i>TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone)<a class="headerlink" href="#trh-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone" name="trh-thyrotropin-releasing-hormone">&para;</a></h3>

</ul>
<h4 class="header"><i>2.2.1</i>Hypothalamic pituitary connections<a class="headerlink" href="#hypothalamic-pituitary-connections" name="hypothalamic-pituitary-connections">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>TRH is released from paraventircular (PVN) and arcuate (ARC) nuclei and transport via infundibulum (stalk that connects hypothalamus and ant. pituitary) to reach thyrotropes. <br />
 -- PVN is superior to ARC, which is right above the median eminence. All three are at the level of third ventricle.<br />
 -- Not all cells in PVN makes TRH. Only those that line the third ventricle do. </li>
<li>pituitary gland rests in sella turcia, a saddle-shaped depression in the sphenoid bone. the stalk is outside of sella turcia <br />
 -- post. pituitary receives arterial blood but ant. pituitary receives venous blood from venux plexus in the stalk (infundibulum) <br />
 -- basically for ant pituitary: arterial blood --&gt; super hypophyseal artery --&gt; venous plexus at the level of the stalk (where hormones from hypothalamus are dumped into) --&gt; secondary venous plexus in ant. pituitary --&gt; hormones in the venous blood act on ant. pituitary --&gt; ant. pituitary secrete its hormones and dump them into the portal blood. </li>
<li>innervation of TRH neurons in PVN<br />
 -- C1/A1 nuclei project onto PVN nucleus and secrete norepinephrine and epinephrine upon cold exposure<br />
 -- ARC secrete neuropeptins onto PVN on appetite control: Orexigenic (NPY and AGRP) and anorexogenic (MSH , CART) </li>
</ul>
<h4 class="header"><i>2.2.2</i>Effects of TRH on TSH-producing cells<a class="headerlink" href="#effects-of-trh-on-tsh-producing-cells" name="effects-of-trh-on-tsh-producing-cells">&para;</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>stimulates secretion of TSH, synthesis of new TSH</li>
<li>glycosylation of TSH at post-translational stage <br />
 -- if TRh is blocked from reaching TSH producing cells --&gt; hypothyroisim (low T3 and T4) because TSH has very little biological activity when it's w/o the carbohydrate moitie. </li>
<li>There are tons of non-hypophysiotropic effects of TRH/TRH derived peptides but you don't need to memorize them unless you want to. </li>

<ul>
<li>T3 can suppress TRH at level of hypothalamus, TSH gene and mRNA translation at ant. pituitary gland and post translational events of TSH. </li>
<li>TRH upregulate TSH in thyrotroph. <br />
 -- Action via transcription factors: CBP and Pit1, which act on transcription of the beta subunit specific for TSH <br />
 -- Pit 1 is also important for prolactin and growth hormone expression. </li>
<li>TSH's pulses: <br />

<h3 class="header"><i>3.1</i>Production##<a class="headerlink" href="#production_1" name="production_1">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Most T3 in human is made outside of the thyroid <br />
 -- T4 is made exclusively in thyroid<br />
 -- 20% T3 comes from thyroid, 80% comes from T4 being converted into T3 by D2 and D1 in the periphery. </li>
<li>T4  ---(D2,D1)--&gt; 5' deiodination --&gt; T3 ---(D3, D1) --&gt; 5-deionization --&gt;T2 (inactive)</li>
<li>T4  ---(D3,D1)--&gt; 5 deiodination --&gt; reverse T3 ---(D2, D1) --&gt; 5'-deionization --&gt;T2 (inactive)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>3.2</i>Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#functions" name="functions">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>T3 is 10X more potent, stronger in affinity, and more abundant than T4. <br />
 -- so T3 is ultimately responsible for most of the thyroid hormone activity <br />
 -- since most T3 comes from T4, T4 can be seen as T3 prohormone</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in liver and kidney, 40% of receptor is occupied and most of them are by T3 from thyroid. </p>
</li>
<li>In ant. pituitary, 90% receptor is occupied<br />
 -- strong negative feedback on TSH secretion --&gt; euthyroid (i.e. normal thyroid) TSH secretion (minimal fraction of maximal secretion potential) <br />
 -- most T3 that bind to pituitary derives from T4 because pituitary likes converting T4 to T3, allowing it to modulate amount of T3 to bind to its receptors. <br />
 -- There's very little T4 found in pituitary nuclei as most of them got converted to T3: <br />
 -- T4 contributes a large fraction of the nuclear T3 in the TSH producing cells. </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>3.3</i>Regulation##<a class="headerlink" href="#regulation" name="regulation">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>T4's importance for TSH regulation can be seen in hypothyroism. <br />
 -- as individuals become more and more hypothyroid-y, T4 would fall while T3 is maintained relatively constant <br />
 -- basically body tries to maintain the higher potency T3 in response to increase need of T3<br />
 -- and ofc, TSH will greatly increase (because receptor occupancy at ant. pituitary falls<br />
 -- as TSH goes up, thyroid produces more T3 (contrary to usually produce 20% of circulating T3) by upregulating D2/D1</li>
<li>in situ hybridization shows cerebral T3 autoregulation<br />
 -- in hypothyroism, D3 mRNA level is low in hippocampus. In hyperthyroism, it's very high. <br />
 -- upregulation of D2 on surface of ventricle and ant. pituitary in hypothyroism --&gt; an effort to maintain T3 level in the brain while circulating level is low<br />
 -- Astrocyte: has OATP (organic anion transport protein) which pumps T4 from serum into the cell. <br />
   --astrocyte has D2 , converting T4 to T3. It also has UPS (ubiquitin protein system) which can degrades D2 (in event of hyperthyroism)<br />
   -- T3 then acts on astrocyte's nucleus or go into neuron via MCT8 (another transport protein) <br />
   -- neuron either inactivate T3 by expressing D3 or T3 acts on nucleus to decrease D3 transcription. <br />
*There are other factors that act on hypothalamus in regulating thyroid hormone --&gt; next class. </li>
