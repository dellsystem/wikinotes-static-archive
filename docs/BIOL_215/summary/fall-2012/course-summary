<p>Question: Do we have any idea of what the early energy sources are?</p>
<p>Yes, very likely it used hydrogen and other energy rich compounds</p>
<p>The environment favors those organisms that can use a variety of energy sources, and thus metabolism is created.</p>

<p>the most popular view is that it evolved in the deep sea, near hydro thermal vents. These hydro thermal vents are like little mini volcanoes in the sense that down in the sea floor where molten rock or magma is in close proximty to the sea bed. Sea water percolates in to the sediment gets heated and boils and rises up through the hydrothermal vents.<br />
There's lots of clays present, there's lots of metal present(metal catalysts), important in polymerization of rna on the clay template. Potential energy sources, hydrogen, sulphide, hydrogen gas that may be used. These conditions existed else where on the earth, but UV radiation was very high because there's no oxygen in the atmosphere(no ozone). Any living organism on the surface of the land will be fried by UV radiation</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>2.3</i>Trophic classification of organisms<a class="headerlink" href="#trophic-classification-of-organisms" name="trophic-classification-of-organisms">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Organisms can be classified by how they obtain energy and carbon - C is one of the most important elements for growth</p>
<ul>
<li>Autotroph - Inorganic C - CO<sub>2</sub><ul>

<p>Chemosynthesis in deep sea bacteria</p>
<p>No sunlight, so they need energy from hydrothermal vents. Tubeworms can grow to 2 meters in length. They rely on bacteria as food source, and the bacteria uses chemosynthesis.</p>
<p>Bacteria: HS<sup>-</sup> + 2O<sub>2</sub> -&gt; SO<sub>4</sub>2- coupled with CO2 + R -&gt; organic molecule</p>

<p>The rate at which organisms can take in energy is limited</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The limitation may be caused by external constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shortage of food in the environment(sunlight, prey)</li>
<li>Food quality: Shitty food, like secondary metabolites which inhibits metabolisms</li>

<ul>
<li>Not enough enzymes to capture the excess of energy(Not enough photosynthetic units to capture an excess of sunlight)</li>

<ul>
<li>Energy is generally limited</li>
<li>Organisms can respond in a way to maximize their intake, a consumer can move in a way that maximize prey coverage</li>

</ul>
<h4 class="header"><i>2.5.1</i>Elements<a class="headerlink" href="#elements" name="elements">&para;</a></h4>
<p>Elements are used to construct cellular constituents and in biochemical reactions that are necessary for survival. They are used for structures and catalysis</p>
<p>Examples: Cellulose, hydroxy apatite(Ca, P), cytochromes(Fe, N)</p>
<p>Organisms don't use every element which exists</p>
<p>There are about 28 elements which are needed, 6 of which make up the bulk: C, H, O, P, N, S. Without these the organisms will suffer in its life<br />
e.g. deficiency in copper = wilson's disease.</p>
<p>If we plot the log of element concentration in the environment vs the log of element concentration in tissue, it appears to be positively correlated. Somewhat. Most elements fall above the 1:1 line, which makes sense, since they must be more concentrated in the organism.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/tga7I.jpg" title="dat Fe" /></p>
<p>Organisms concentrate and extract elements from their environment. The concentrations of essential elements varies among different environments and over geological time. The change in concentration influenced the requirements of the elements required in elements.</p>

<p>Step-wise evolution is influenced by the way of thinking known as 'the great chain of being' (Evolutionary Bias). The idea is that there's a scale of being where you start with a simple organism, and you go up until the most complex organism.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/70Qbl.jpg" title="LOL they were idiots" /></p>
<p>Step-wise evolution is sort of false. The reality is that evolution is more like a tree.</p>
<p>According to step-wise evolution, multicelluarity evolved once. Actually, it evolved a minimum of 13 times across different kingdoms. Thus, evolution is multidirectional.</p>

<li>Too specialized upon appearance in the fossil record to have originated in the cambrian?</li>
</ul>
<p>It's accepted that burgess shale fauna is a stem group from which modern species are derived - conway morris is corrected. </p>
<p>Of 1.2 billion yrs of animal evolution, modern humans have been on the planet for 200k years.</p>
<p><strong> For midterm understand molecular clocks and do molecular clock &lt;-&gt; tree conversion </strong></p>
<p>There are only 35 phyla of animals - Why only 35? It is a mystery.</p>
<p>If the cambrian explosion is a true explosion, the animals must've originated and diversified into 35 phyla in that short period of time.<br />
If we believe in the molecular clock, originated first, then during cambrian explosion it radiated. It's possible that they could not have fossilized before the evolution of skeletons, availability of CaCO<sub>3</sub> caused skeletons to form. Large body size also evolved during cambrian, maybe when they were small, it's hard to be fossilized/discovered.<br />
It could be a larger body sized allowed animals to diversify more, as it's able to occupy previously undiscovered niches.</p>
<p>Radiation facilitated by highly conserved developmental genes - they are already in place during the cambrian.</p>

<li>Evolutionary success = reproductive sucess, survival is not enough</li>
</ul>
<p>Sexual selection is not survival from biotic or abiotic conditions, but members of one sex compete for the opportunity for preferential mating with members of the opposite sex.</p>

<li>One single ancestral species gives rise to new descendant species, an occur in two principle ways:<ul>
<li>Allopatric</li>
<li>Sympatric</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually follwed by ecological isolation</p>
<p>Allopatric speciation(Geographic isolation): A physical barrier forms that split a population, and differences accumulates in the subpopulations, eventually leading into speciation.</p>
<p>Peripatric: A type of allopatric where a small colony is split off, into an island or whatever</p>
<p>Parapatric: Different adapations between two subpopulations, but there is still gene flow (No speciation)</p>
<p>Genetic drift: Bottleneck effect, in theory</p>
<h4 class="header"><i>14.5.1</i>Speciation without geographical isolation<a class="headerlink" href="#speciation-without-geographical-isolation" name="speciation-without-geographical-isolation">&para;</a></h4>
<p>An important debate in evolutionary biology has been whether speciation can be initiated sympatrically by mechanisms that reduce gene flow within a population in the absence of initiation geographical isolation - sympatric speciation</p>
<p>This means that a biological barrier to gene exchange has to arise within the confines of a randomly mating population without any spatial segregation of the species.  This is very controversial with many theoretical difficulties. E.g. cichlid fishes (sexual selection leading to speciation), polyploidy in plants.</p>
<h3 class="header"><i>14.6</i>Reproductive Isolating Mechanisms<a class="headerlink" href="#reproductive-isolating-mechanisms" name="reproductive-isolating-mechanisms">&para;</a></h3>
<p>There are two types of reproductive isolation mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those that act before fertilization of the egg - prezygotic</li>
<li>Those that act after fertilization of the egg - postzygotic</li>
</ul>
<p>Prezygotic Mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spatial (Geographical) isolation</li>
<li>Ecological isolation, species use different resources</li>
<li>Behavioral isolation, different mating rituals</li>
<li>Temporal isolation, mating season differs, or being active at different times during the day</li>
</ul>
<p>After mating:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mechanical separation, the key doesn't fit the lock</li>
<li>Prevention of gamete fusion, egg and sperm fail to attract each other</li>
</ul>
<p>After fertilization:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hybrid embryo does not develop properly</li>
<li>Hybrid adults do not survive in nature</li>
<li>Hybrid adults are sterile or have reduced fertility</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> KNOW THIS FOR THE MIDTERM </strong></p>
<p>Sexual isolation in sympatric and allopatric populations</p>
<p>Higher the sexual isolation index, the more difficult it is to form hybrids. Sympatric species have a much higher sexual isolation index</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://i.imgur.com/Tkk8y.jpg" title="" /></p>
<p>This is because for sympatric populations, after mating and post-zygotic mechanisms must be used to prevent gene flow, thus strong sexual isolation must exist. Allopatric populations have a very strong prezygotic mechanism that separates the subpopulations before any sexual isolation have to occur.</p>
<h2 class="header"><i>15</i>Extinction<a class="headerlink" href="#extinction" name="extinction">&para;</a></h2>

<h4 class="header"><i>15.1.3</i>Mass extinctions<a class="headerlink" href="#mass-extinctions" name="mass-extinctions">&para;</a></h4>
<p>The loss of species from many different groups - it takes large numbers of species. <br />
They occur infrequently and abruptly over short periods of geological time<br />
There are 5 mass extinction events:</p>
<ul>
<li>end of ordovician -12%</li>
<li>late devonian -14%</li>
<li>end of permian -52%</li>
<li>end of triassic -12%</li>
<li>end of cretaceous -11% (dinosaurs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Extraterrestrial impacts</p>
<ul>
<li>Extraterrestrial impacts are known to have battered the moon and earth about 4 bya</li>
<li>100 craters on earth<ul>
<li>tem meteors, each one km in diameter, are estimated to have each produced 20 km wide craters at a frequency of 1/400k years</li>
<li>50 km wide crater is produced once every 12.5 my</li>
<li>150 km wide crater is produced once every 100 my</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No land vertebrate larger than a labrador dog survived, known as the KT boundary</p>
<p>Violent volcanic eruptions, plumes of deep mantle material also can cause this mass extinction event</p>
<h3 class="header"><i>15.2</i>Neodarwinism<a class="headerlink" href="#neodarwinism" name="neodarwinism">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Microevolution is happening constantly and is a long drawn process, we don't see immediate species because fossilization doesn't always occur</p>
<p>Paleontologists, however, recognized that:</p>
<p>1) species appear abruptly in the fossil record<br />
2) persist for long periods of time<br />
3) then abruptyly disappear</p>
<p>This was first thought to be an artifact of the fossil record; however, intermediate fossils began to be discovered.</p>
<p>Suggested that this pattern was real and not an artifact</p>
<p>Proposed the idea of <strong>Quantum evolution</strong></p>
<p>Species enter adaptive zones where they undergo very rapid radiation</p>
<h3 class="header"><i>15.3</i>Micro vs macro evolution<a class="headerlink" href="#micro-vs-macro-evolution" name="micro-vs-macro-evolution">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Microevolution: slight short term evolutionary changes within species</p>
<p>Macroevolution: term for the evolution of great phenotypic changes</p>
<p>Are micro and macro evolution driven by the same mechanisms?</p>
<p>Is natural selection enough to explain the diversity we see?</p>
