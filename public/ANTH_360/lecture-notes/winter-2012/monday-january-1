<p>Prof’s blurb:<br />
Archaeology borrows approach and theories from many related disciplines: <br />
Considered a cluster of methods, rather than a single method</p>
<p>ANTH360 Lecture 2<br />
Archaeology<br />
What is it?<br />
A discipline?<br />
A method?<br />
An approach to understanding information about the past<br />
A method to recover information about past</p>
<p>*Contributes to better understanding of the time<br />
Archaeology as 4 fields<br />
Biological/physical anthropology: study of human biological or physical characteristics and how they evolved<br />
Cultural/social anthropology: analyzes human culture and society <br />
Archaeology: “past tense of cultural anthropology”</p>
<p>Analyzes past human culture and societies through material remains (material culture)<br />
*how to interpret something without any informants?<br />
 (Ethnoarchaeology: analyzes how past societies used material culture by studying how present cultures use similar objects)<br />
Linguistics: study of languages, their acquisition, structure and meaning</p>
<p>Archaeology as history<br />
99% of human existence happened before historical documentation<br />
Prehistory: no written records of events<br />
Protohistory: line between having some written records or visual information; civilization with a language, but cannot read it; history recorded through other civilization’s language or by other civilizations<br />
History: events are already known, and asks more specific questions about the events<br />
Study of specifics</p>
<p>Archaeology as science<br />
Unlike texts, archaeological data must be interpreted<br />
Scientific method<br />
Collect evidence<br />
Conduct experiments<br />
Make hypothesis: a testable proposition to account for the data<br />
Test hypo against data<br />
Make model (a description) that best summarizes pattern observed in data</p>
<p>*Individual items cannot tell you much – need to know its context to infer its use or meaning<br />
Study of the general </p>
<p>*in comparison to the historical approach<br />
Hypothesis testing vs. Hermeneutical circle</p>
<p>*hermeneutical: constantly reforming questions referring to the data<br />
Hypothesis testing is more common in processual arch<br />
Hermeneutical is more common in post-processual<br />
Interpretation: functionality <br />
Context is crucial for interpretation of objects</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>e.g. pictures of an Aztec ceremonial knife and a kitchen knife: both objects are knives<br />
when out of context, information is lost because where the knife was used is important to its function<br />
Different explanations come out of contexts <br />
Arch goals and Questions<br />
Reconstructions of past (traditional approach)<br />
Seek to reconstruct past but also to understand why change took place (processual approach (1950-60s))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>e.g. Why did some bands or tribes move? Why did they become sedentary?<br />
Seek to reconstruct symbolic and cognitive systems of past (post-processual or post-structural approach (1970-80s))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>questions about ideational aspects<br />
Possible to answer these questions in some situations, but not easy <br />
Ex) picture of ancient clay beds</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*People needed to get the clay from somewhere; why choose this place? etc<br />
Arch, anthropology and culture<br />
Anthropology: study of humanity<br />
Biological characteristics<br />
Non-biological char: culture<br />
Culture: knowledge beliefs art, morals, law, custom and other capabilities and habits acquired by a member of society<br />
Anthropologically, non-biological, unique aspect of a particular society<br />
Archaeologically:<br />
groups of artefact types at a particular moment in time = assemblages<br />
Groups of assemblages = archaeological culture</p>
<p>Take groups of assemblages, and call it arch.al culture</p>
<p>Dates<br />
Radiocarbon dates (C14)<br />
Example: 895 +- 75years </p>
<p>*you get a range of dates, rather than a date; but you get a rough idea of how old the object is<br />
useful for organic object, which contains carbon<br />
useless for dating anything older than 30,000years<br />
B.C/A.D.<br />
Before Christ/anno domini<br />
B.C.E/C.E.<br />
Before common era/ Common era<br />
B.P.<br />
Before present<br />
With the present officially starting at 1950</p>
<p>*Created to avoid complications associated with the dates above<br />
Geography<br />
(refer to powerpoint slides)<br />
How china is usually studied:<br />
Study china only, without context, <br />
But China should be considered in terms of its surroundings<br />
Many things considered traditionally Chinese come from regions outside of china, to form Chinese culture<br />
Vast amount of mixing and exchanging through time<br />
China-US area and latitudinal comparisons<br />
Latitudes, breadth about the same<br />
Without Alaska, China is larger<br />
Climate<br />
SE china: combination of no dry season and dry winter zones<br />
SW china: highland zone – dry weather, warm daytime, cold nighttimes<br />
NE side of china similar to Canadian weather<br />
Mountains and deserts<br />
Mts run east-west (in western region) and north-south (in eastern regions)<br />
Natural barriers created by the mountain<br />
Important to know in terms of migration<br />
Mountains in the east are much lower<br />
Rivers (4 major ones)<br />
West (Hong Kong at the delta)<br />
Yangtze (Shanghai at the delta)<br />
Heilong Jiang <br />
Yellow river<br />
the “Sorrow of China”<br />
Millions killed by the constant flooding<br />
Dikes don’t hold up long <br />
There are Chinese versions of Pompeii due to collapsed silt <br />
farming in the mountains causes a lot of soil to go down the hill<br />
Fast-flowing in middle parts of china, no way for silt to settle so the silt flows to the delta and pile up<br />
Changes in channels over time<br />
Highlighted zone: where all major rivers in Asia start<br />
Indus<br />
Mekong river<br />
Potential damming of huge tributary to Mekong river<br />
Issue because of water rights; the supply may be cut off<br />
Salween<br />
Elevation: highlands in west, low in east<br />
Less rain in the mountains; more in lowlands<br />
The rain is not frequent in NW, because land (mountains) blocks it<br />
Less hospitable for agriculture, land not as fertile<br />
Population<br />
1.5 billion<br />
Everyone clustered in the coast<br />
80% of people in 1/3 of area of the country<br />
Chinese archaeology focuses on this 1/3 of the area <br />
People in less populated regions also contributed, but got little attention<br />
Precipitation<br />
West SW, drier NW: climate guides where people live<br />
People in the past overcame aspect of their environment; lived in inhospitable conditions<br />
Need particular and specific technological innovations to do so <br />
There are, nevertheless, less people in these regions; people prefer to live comfortably, without the aid of techs<br />
Seismicity of china 23000 BC to present<br />
Subfield of archaeology: archaeology of earthquakes<br />
Doesn’t happen everywhere, but concentrations in Taiwan<br />
Green dot for Sichuan earthquake<br />
Natural vegetation<br />
Follows climate<br />
Particular animals live according to the climate and vegetation<br />
Some of these animals are domesticated, and/or are related to agriculture<br />
Huge variety of landscape conditions<br />
Fuels, power, minerals and metals<br />
NW China rich in petroleum <br />
NE China with coal<br />
90% of rare minerals come from inner Mongolia<br />
Oil fields <br />
natural gas had been used for heating, but industrial use started in 1600s<br />
People<br />
Wide diversity of people in china<br />
Chinese flag: <br />
Big star for communists<br />
Fours stars for major groups of ppl<br />
Hans take up 90 or more % of the pop<br />
There are 66 ethnicities recognized in China<br />
in Chinese terminology, they are referred to as national minorities/ethnicities</p>
<p>ex) Turkic<br />
From intermarriage between Persian and Chinese during Silk Road trading<br />
Language<br />
Sinotibetan<br />
mandarin<br />
Southern<br />
Tibetan<br />
Kam-tai<br />
Miao Yao<br />
Indo-European<br />
Tajik (Persian)<br />
Austro-Asiatic<br />
Mon-Khimer<br />
Altai<br />
Turkic<br />
Mongolian<br />
Manchu-Tiungus<br />
Korean </p>
<p>= … huge variety<br />
HOW DO WE EXPECT A UNIFIED CULTURE IN A LAND OF SUCH VARIETY?<br />
Diversity is in the present and in the past<br />
They all contribute to now-called china<br />
GDP<br />
Richer states in the coast<br />
NW rich thanks to oil, but wealth not evenly distributed<br />
Easier to seize economic opportunities in the east<br />
Communications and trade better developed<br />
One of china’s economic aim in the next 10 years: narrow the gap between rich and poor<br />
People in Beijing and Guangzhou (East coast): live 21C lives – not much different from Canadian<br />
Have cell phones, cars, same standard of living<br />
Amazing unbelievable rate of change in the last 30 years<br />
The rest of the area, without as much economic prosperity; 19C lives<br />
Huge contrast<br />
China is trying to spread out the access to prosperity, and bring benefits to people’s lives<br />
Territorial<br />
Provinces <br />
Autonomous regions<br />
Mostly in Outer China<br />
Places where large minority ethnicities are located<br />
They want the government to reflect the views of the minority group<br />
The political system is structured that an official of these regions always has a secretary<br />
e.g.) there’s the governor, then provincial communist secretary; there’s a mayor of the city, then the secretary<br />
Party secretaries are always han Chinese, and they always trump <br />
Municipalities; cities – administrative district<br />
Chongching – region broken off from Sichuan for autonomous decision-making<br />
Hong kong –  has its own citizenship, but part of china<br />
Had been a British colony for 99 year<br />
Has been returned on a condition that they retain some control for the next 50 years<br />
Macau – also has its own citizenship, but part of china<br />
Portuguese colony – 99 year lease</p>
<p>These municipalities have issues of citizenship, maternity tourism, power struggles against China over media, etc<br />
Taiwan<br />
Claimed by PRC, controlled by RC<br />
Other boundaries not set in stone; debates everywhere<br />
Economic development<br />
Professor’s story: took one year to construct a railway across a tiny town by Chengdu – now the town is a huge city<br />
Environmental macro-zones<br />
N china plain – most fertile areas in china, ever<br />
Most densely populated areas in china<br />
Due to traditional land allotment (every son gets a bit of land), not enough land for everyone – great poverty<br />
Cultural stereotypes exist between regions<br />
Migrant workers in various areas in China<br />
Heavy silt deposition around Yangtze and Yellow river <br />
Loess – particular type of soil from glacial movement; particularly fertile<br />
A lot of clay comes from loess, because loess stick together<br />
For agriculture, need a lot of improvement to the land <br />
First trace of agriculture here; perhaps due o the need of tools<br />
Also deposition in areas next to Sichuan<br />
Ringed with mountains; isolated<br />
Sichuan had contact with the rest of the land, but degree of interaction was limited in comparison</p>
<p>= Correlation between loess deposition and early sites<br />
Some oasis along the silk road<br />
The desert has a descriptive name in Chinese – those who come in don’t come out<br />
Zangarian (?) basin: grasslands – allowed for different lifestyle<br />
Populated by nomads, with herds of sheep and horses<br />
Along Yangtze: gorges –  such geographical conditions affected communication and cultural interactions<br />
At the mouth of the river, shanghai<br />
NE china: fertile plain for agriculture (only withtin the last several hundred years)<br />
Cold and dry climate<br />
Lower NE china: bands of grasslands connect across the northern section of Eurasian continent<br />
Horses<br />
Mongols – conquered most of the known world thanks to the openness of the steppe lands<br />
Himalayas<br />
Highest mountains here<br />
S china<br />
Also mountains, restricted transportation<br />
Changes in courses of the Yellow river</p>
<p>Prehistoric environment<br />
Pleistocene period (1.8mya to 12kya)<br />
Lower, middle, upper<br />
Holocene period (from the end of last glacial cycle 12-1500BP) <br />
The last geological era (modern)<br />
At the mouths of Yangtze and yellow river: sediment is building more land<br />
Changes in the coastline<br />
The glacial period: glacier made of ice – dropped the sea levels<br />
The area in green was land<br />
Clear evidence of transmission between korea/taiwan and mainland<br />
In the Neolithic period (8000-2000BCE) <br />
In Shandong area, mountains – the only arch sites are at the base of the mountain, which is under the sea now<br />
By 5000BC, all sites move towards mountains<br />
River changed the coastline; no early sites in the fertile plains; covered by alluvium<br />
Early landscapes in hills <br />
Site locations show the environmental conditions<br />
People start following the coast<br />
Changing landscape<br />
Alleviation started early</p>
