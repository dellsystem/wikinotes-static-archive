        <p>Cradles of Civilization: China <br />
Introduction<br />
China has an ancient tradition of historical study, but over the last few decades, entered a Golden Age<br />
Recurring themes in history:<br />
Us vs. them<br />
Center vs. periphery<br />
Attempts at unity vs. diversity<br />
Physical and political isolation vs. cultural interplay<br />
Efforts at modernization vs. traditional conservatism<br />
Tracking the processes of changes in what now amounted to Chinese civilization</p>
<p>The land<br />
A vast territory and huge geographic diversity<br />
Two large zones:<br />
Inner China: AKA China Proper – fertile and densely populated region within…<br />
Outer China – large NW arc with mountains and deserts<br />
Civilization arose in association with agriculture<br />
Centers in agriculturally productive areas<br />
River valleys and floodplains: fertile alluvial soil, irrigation, climate (long growing seasons, adequate rainfall, and warm), transportation </p>
<p>Outer China<br />
China on a floor of highly metamorphosed rock<br />
Tibetan mountain ranges<br />
Mt Everest (10000m)<br />
Plateau (3500m)<br />
Alpine desert: too cold and too dry<br />
Fertile lowland pockets (e.g. Lhasa)<br />
Pastoral nomadism with yak<br />
Tarim Desert<br />
Inhospitable to agriculture<br />
Dzungaria region<br />
Better watered, with Illi River<br />
In Xinjiang, Turfan Depression (200m below sea level)<br />
Three great river valleys and plains<br />
Huang (north)<br />
Yangzi (central)<br />
Xi (south)<br />
Shorter, with delta near Guangzhou</p>
<p>Civilization rose around Huang and Yangzi<br />
Qin (221-207 BC) and Han (206BC – AD220) conquered much of Outer China<br />
Qing (1644-1911) reconquered these area again<br />
For less than a century, some Mongols controlled parts of Outer China<br />
Inner Mongolia<br />
Long-grass steppe ideal for grazing<br />
Served as the basis for pastoral nomadism (with sheep and goat)<br />
Now mostly farmed<br />
Became Chinese territory since the collapse of Mongol empire in 14C<br />
with economic growth and infrastructure, Chinese farmers moved in and now outnumber Mongols<br />
grazing economy now commercial (not nomadic): sell animal products<br />
Northeast: AKA Manchuria<br />
Bordered by mountain barriers<br />
Linked to north China by Mountain Sea Gate, a narrow coastal plain<br />
Historically served as the route of invasion and migration<br />
Most areas too cold and too dry for farming; Liao River valley milder, and has fertile alluvial soil<br />
Commercialized agricultural products: wheat and soybeans<br />
Amur River marks the border with Russia<br />
Yalu River and Changbai shan mark the border with Korea<br />
Rich with coal, iron and petroleum</p>
<p>China Proper<br />
Includes most of the agricultural land, majority of population and roots of civilization<br />
Huang <br />
Semi-arid climate river <br />
deposit alluvial soil/silt <br />
extend the coastline <br />
e.g. Shandong used to be an island in the Yellow Sea <br />
 the “Sorrow of China”: seasonal fluctuations in volume and recurrent changes in its course lead to disastrous floods<br />
Drowned people and land, and silting damaged and ruined irrigation works<br />
On the other hand, silt deposits made the area the most fertile agricultural zone in china<br />
Widespread deposition: river course and delta never stable<br />
Yangzi River<br />
The most important river system in China Proper<br />
Half of Chinese people live in the basin<br />
Especially the delta is densely settled (e.g. Nanjing, Shanghai)<br />
Navigable tributaries: <br />
useful for transportation &amp; trade<br />
Coupled with natural reservoirs (i.e. lakes), reduce flooding<br />
Yangzi navigable for ocean-going ships<br />
Dug gorges in Sichuan<br />
Occasional disastrous flooding<br />
Deforestration since 1949 increased the rates of flooding, erosion, etc<br />
Not as heavily silt-laden as Huang<br />
Delta very fertile, and heavily cultivated<br />
Plains are extending seaward, thanks to silt deposition<br />
Intricate navigable waterways link every settlement<br />
Aided growth of commerce<br />
e.g. shanghai is the largest, most populous and commercialized cities in modern china<br />
xi river<br />
lesser stream with restricted watershed<br />
lacks major tributaries<br />
basins mountainous and less productive<br />
used for transport in its navigable lower half<br />
Guangzhou in delta area</p>
<p>Divisions<br />
Clear distinction between the mountainous south and level north<br />
One of the few well-defined mountain ranges in China Proper; Qinling range from Gansu to Henan<br />
Physical and cultural line between dry north and more productive south<br />
Blocks cold northern wind and contributes to southern agriculture<br />
North Hangzhou Bay: long sandy coast with shallow water, few good ports</p>
<p>Vs. south china has heavily indented coasts – natural harbours<br />
From Tang, port cities engaged in extensive ocean commerce<br />
Base of piracy in the countless smaller harbours – easy to hide from government forces<br />
In Ming dynasty, huge expedition projects launched here<br />
Accommodated fleets of oceangoing ships</p>
<p>The People <br />
Chronology<br />
Chinese state arose in Huang’s flood plain (modern Henan)<br />
Shang dynasty: <br />
Built successive capitals in modern Luoyang, Zhengzhou, and Anyang<br />
In 1050BC, fell to slave revolt coupled with Zhou (feudal dependency which was supposed to guard shang’s western frontiers)<br />
Zhou dynasty:<br />
Capital in Anyang, then in Luoyang (770BC)<br />
Warring state<br />
Qin found the first empire in 221BC<br />
Unified the north and much of the south under a single rule for the first time<br />
Built the Great Wall to limit the raid of northern nomads (e.g. Xiongnu)<br />
Ineffective defence, but served as boundary between the irrigation-dependent north and the better watered south, and between Chinese and barbarian (i.e. non-Chinese)<br />
Some farmers ventured north, but returned south when drier weather came<br />
Short-lived empire; fell in 206BC<br />
Han dynasty<br />
New capital Chang’an near Zhou capitals<br />
Capital moved to Luoyang in  25AD<br />
Consolidated imperial rule<br />
Expansion of territory<br />
Collapse in 220AD<br />
Political disunity<br />
North controlled by series of non-Chinese<br />
Sui dynasty<br />
At the end of 6C, re-established all-China empire – the area within the modern Chinese border<br />
Tang<br />
Capital at Chang’an<br />
Collapse in 907AD</p>
<p>Economy<br />
Impact of the Chinese on their landscape perhaps the heaviest in the world<br />
Due to large population, millennia of agriculture, industrialization etc<br />
By Shang dynasty, cleared most forests in north China<br />
6C BC iron tools made clearing land easier; central and south China also cleared<br />
With growth in agriculture, growth in population: from 5-10 mil in Shang to 60 mil under Han<br />
Enormous pressure on land to support the population<br />
By Tang dynasty, north deforested, cultivated area eroded, irrigation networks silted and land forced out of use<br />
By mid-Tang, the northwest (where the state began) so economically marginalized that most people lived in south <br />
Needed to adjust farming techniques for the poorly soiled south<br />
Also, other people had been living in the Yangzi and Xi valleys<br />
neolithic cultures here had entered bronze age<br />
Fewer evidence of these Neolithic cultures, so the picture is unclear but..<br />
Their rice, water buffalo, tropical root crops, chickens and pigs diffused northwards<br />
Yangzi basin still called “china’s rice bowl”<br />
Before these reached the north, millet was the principal crop<br />
After the fall of the Han dynasty, Chinese fled South<br />
Deforestration and cultivation of land expanded southwards; national capitals successively moved southwards<br />
Pre-agricultural non-chinese displaced, and Chinese and their wet-rice agriculture took over<br />
On-going process that continues today (e.g. in Tibet)<br />
Period of peace in Qing dynasty<br />
At the end of 18C, traditional Chinese agriculture reached a peak of efficiency and of yields<br />
Furthered only by the introduction of new technologies (e.g. artificial fertilizer)<br />
Traditional system marginalized animal farming<br />
Discouraged less productive use for land to support animals<br />
Draft animals never raised for food; some animals raised as scavengers<br />
In northern steppes, however, grazers (sheep and goat), camels and horses raised<br />
Introduction of New World crops (such as maize and potatoes) in 16C<br />
Population doubled or tripled<br />
Deterioration of imperial government + inability to increase agricultural output further = China sunk into mass poverty and technological backwardness<br />
Since 1949, the Communist government tried, but disastrously failed to solve these problems<br />
Population doubled between 1949 and 1990, despite the one-child policy imposed in 1981<br />
Famine between 1958 and 1963: over 30 mil starved to death<br />
Though famine eliminated, food supply just barely meets the demand<br />
Agriculture remains the heart of Chinese economy<br />
But there is no new land to feasibly) cultivate<br />
Potential economic resources include: <br />
Deposits of coal, aluminum, and iron etc<br />
oil reserves<br />
hydroelectric potential on the Yangzi system<br />
too expensive and immense to develop<br />
 = positive outlook<br />
Technological lag in nearly all fields, due to self-imposed isolation from the rest of the world (from 50s to 80s)</p>
<p>Cities<br />
Since at least Han times, China has had more and larger cities than any other part of the world<br />
Urban portion of the population 10% by Qing dynasty<br />
Ming, Qing, Han, Tang and Song capitals with population of over a million<br />
Administration of the empire rested on hierarchy of cities: <br />
imperial capital  provincial  regional urban centers  cities<br />
but China remained predominantly agrarian<br />
with industrialization (late 19C), cities grew rapidly<br />
in northeast for mining and manufacturing industries<br />
shanghai, as the commercial center<br />
has no local raw material, but has water connections<br />
other treaty ports, thanks to foreign powers<br />
new emphasis on national-regional balance: promote urban industrial growth in poorer and more remote areas<br />
in the Communist mode/highly centralized system, national capital Beijing grew enormously<br />
modernizing and expanding outwards, and remains of imperial past demolished (except the Forbidden City)<br />
major problem remains: producing enough to satisfy the needs of an immense and growing population</p>
<p>Rediscovering the Past<br />
the perception of continuity with the past is crucial<br />
historical precedents legitimize of political power or actions<br />
rich tradition of historical and philological scholarship<br />
traditional antiquarianism (jinxixue) continue to inform the practice of modern field archaeology (kaoguxue)</p>
<p>Early stages<br />
overall:<br />
Shang dynasty Elites collect and ritually use ancient objects<br />
Neolithic jade from Anyang tombs predate the Shang by a millennium<br />
Throughout the Bronze Age, paraphernalia of ancestral worship were handed down within lineages<br />
Ritual bronzes of previous dynasty continued to be transmitted from dynasty to dynasty as tokens of sovereignty<br />
Han dynasty: lower ranking individuals also collected antiquities<br />
Scholarly approach<br />
Historical documents and chronicles kept throughout Zhou dynasty<br />
First narrative account of history composed after 4C BC<br />
Scholarship on the past began in Han dynasty<br />
Sima Qian’s (145-80BC) Shiji (“Records of the historian”) is the first of the official compiled history<br />
Xu Shen’s (58-147AD) shuiwen jiezi (“discussing the graphs and explaining the characters”) is a dictionary and a key to the early stages of Chinese writings<br />
Beginning of Chinese epigraphy</p>
<p>Traditional antiquarianism<br />
During Song dynasty (AD960 to 1279), Confucius scholars focused on ritual bronzes from the past<br />
Two catalogues: Kaogutu (“illustrations for enquiry into antiquity”) and Bogutulu (”pictorial record widely opening up antiquity”)<br />
Accurate records of shapes, ornaments, size and inscription of bronzes and other antiquities<br />
Valuable records because the actual objects were lost during wars<br />
Based on these, later scholars produced specialized studies on inscriptions<br />
Qing dynasty (1644-1911) scholars also focused on other categories of antiquities<br />
Developed sophisticated methods of critical analysis of literature and used material, non-textual evidence in explaining passages in the classics<br />
Concentrated on the study of individual artefacts and took little interest in aspects of ancient culture outside of the text-based scholarship<br />
Continued influence on modern archaeology<br />
Song classification of bronzes is useful tool</p>
<p>The advent of modern archaeology<br />
Turn of 20C, discovered inscribed oracle bones near Anyang (the last capital of the Shang dynasty)<br />
Proved the accuracy of Shang royal genealogy as given by Sima Qian<br />
Great counterevidence against the claims of the new, iconoclastic school called yigupai (“the doubters of antiquity”)<br />
led by Gu Jiegang (1893-1979), yigupai…<br />
 doubted the authenticity and accuracy of the classical texts<br />
Reevaluated the entirety of the Chinese cultural tradition during the May Fourth movement of 1919<br />
Called for new standards of proof for historical arguments<br />
Realized the value of excavations as a means to open up new perspectives on Chinese history<br />
1928, the first Chinese scholars trained in modern field archaeology began to work in China<br />
Li Ji (1896-1976) and Liang Siyong (1904-54), sponsored by Academia Sinica and Institute of philology and history, directed excavations of Shang palaces and royal tombs in Anyang <br />
Interrupted by the Japanese invasion</p>
<p>Early developments in prehistoric archaeology<br />
Apart from some contributions of Japanese scholars during WW2, Chinese auspices were in charge of all serious fieldwork in the core areas of Chinese dynastic civilization <br />
Only major contribution from a foreigner: Swedish geologist Andersson founded prehistoric archaeology in china<br />
Discovered homo erectus fossils and conducted long-term research in Zhoukoudian<br />
Identified neolithic sites in northern china<br />
E.g. Yangshao<br />
Crude excavation methods: he had geological dating methods, and little intest in cultural context of the artifacts<br />
In 1934, the academia sinica published the first full-scale report of Chinese prehistorical site: Chengziyai in Shandong, with Longshan culture<br />
Scholars recognized the differences between Neolithic cultures<br />
Overall impression of early cultural diversity</p>
<p>From WW2 to the cultural revolution<br />
After the war, Institute of philology and history moved to Taiwan <br />
Mid-70s, field research began in Taiwan <br />
Methods now heavily influenced by American trends<br />
On the mainland, the Communist government generously sponsored archaeology<br />
Institute of Archaeology (founded in 1950) coordinate archaeological research in the country<br />
Permanent field stations at important sites: Anyang, capitals near Xian and Luoyang, and Erlitou<br />
The rapid pace of construction of infrastructure (i.e. destruction of archaeological sites) imposed urgent practical demands for archaeologists<br />
Xia Nai (1910-85) concentrated research efforts on a small number of sites in the core area of early dynasties <br />
Aimed to establish a standard archaeological chronology<br />
More recent sites also excavated, and extended the scope of archaeology from prehistory to 17C AD<br />
Establishment of a uniform method of typological analysis in the 50s<br />
Su Bingqi (1909-) adapted Swedish principles<br />
Archaeologists and government expected that results of excavation would demonstrate the conformity of Chinese history to the Marxist Scheme of social development<br />
But so far, results are ambiguous</p>
<p>From the cultural revolution to the 90s<br />
Cultural revolution (1966-76) disrupted the progress of Chinese archaeology; all preoccupation with traditional culture became a dangerous thing to pursue<br />
Destruction of ancient sites, etc<br />
Post-CR: to match growing tourism, there was a new emphasis on “exhibition value” of archaeological finds, and  sites were turned into tourist attractions<br />
Economic reforms led to administrative decentralization; now with more power, provinces vied to demonstrate their own historical importance<br />
Regional kind of centralism arose</p>
<p>Current outlook<br />
With relaxation of government controls, illicit lootings of archaeological sites devastate fieldwork<br />
Some governments ceased to support fieldwork<br />
Archaeologists seek external help – hope for joint research</p>
<p>The beginnings of a settled life<br />
Features of civilization appeared before written records began<br />
Two large periods<br />
Paleolithic (1.7mil to 10kya) <br />
Period of human evolution and hunting-gathering societies<br />
Neolithic (10 to 4kya)<br />
Sedentary societies, agricultural lifestyle with potteries, start of social stratification<br />
By convention, Neolithic period ends at 2kya, with the introduction of bronze vessels<br />
How Chinese civilization grew from Neolithic period is under debate<br />
Many distinct prehistorical cultures existed<br />
Culture: a group of communities with similar potteries, houses, styles of burial, etc.<br />
named after a particular site<br />
interaction between many regions and cultures was an important factor in rise of Chinese civilization</p>
<p>agriculture<br />
before food production, people were nomadic hunters and gatherers<br />
7kya: appearance of agriculture and sedentary villages<br />
10-7kya: evidence of pottery-making in rock shelters, such as Zenpiyan and Xianrendong<br />
Associated with wild animal remains, possibly domesticated pigs and cultivated root crops<br />
Period of transition; more research to be done<br />
7-5kya: clearly agricultural villages<br />
in north China: peiligang, Cishan<br />
Several hundred inhabitants grew millet, hemp and cabbages, and kept domesticated animals<br />
In south: <br />
Grew rice, water chestnuts, pigs, water buffalo and chickens<br />
E.g. Hemudu (5.5-4k)<br />
Wooden houses on stilts above marshy waters<br />
Tools indicate that the inhabitants were skilled woodworkers and bone carvers; they crafted perishable material as well<br />
Plants and animal remains show dramatic evolutionary changes  agriculture had been practiced for a while before the occupations at these villages<br />
Note that hunting and gathering doesn’t cease entirely<br />
Agriculture  settled life  permanent houses  storage of food do other things in life = complexity</p>
<p>The development of complex societies<br />
5-1.9kya: villages became societies with social classes<br />
4.5kya: emergence of elite groups, as evidenced by specific ritual objects and wealth <br />
3-2kya: important features of the Bronze Age (e.g. walled towns, bronze metallurgy, divination, etc) appear in embryonic form<br />
1.9kya: Xia, the first bronze age dynasty appear <br />
Neolithic period ended and dynastic period began</p>
<p>Early beginnings (5-3kya)<br />
Chinese civilization developed through an interaction of diverse cultures and ideas<br />
Comparisons of Neolithic cultures: Yangshao of Henan vs. Dawenkou of Shandong<br />
Both are clusters of small villages with shamanistic religion</p>
<p>Yangshao: <br />
E.g. Banpo and Jiangji<br />
villages surrounded by a ditch<br />
defence against animal and human enemies<br />
symbolic divide between the world of the living and the world of the dead<br />
semisubterranean round or square houses<br />
hearths for cooking and heating<br />
wide benches<br />
large houses are surrounded by  smaller ones<br />
large houses may be communal<br />
no known display of wealth or position<br />
simple burials<br />
small quantity of grave goods<br />
one interesting case: remains flanked with mosaics of a tiger and a dragon <br />
interpreted as a burial of a shaman<br />
highly decorative pottery<br />
earlier designs depict human figures, animals, etc<br />
later designs depict geometric arrangements, similar to pottery designs of neighbouring cultures</p>
<p>Dawenkou<br />
e.g. yedian<br />
burials with many ornate cooking and serving vessels (such as ding, gui, and dou)<br />
such designs are nonexistent in yangshao sites<br />
more elaborate meals, at least during burial rituals<br />
both rich and poor burials more elaborate<br />
some burials have log chambers filled with burial goods<br />
evidence of hierarchy and inequality<br />
vatlike vessels and a range of drinking and pouring vessels<br />
D brewed an alcoholic beverage similar to those known from the Zhou dynasty<br />
More sophisticated ceramic tech<br />
D vessels more frequently had appendages, such as legs and spouts<br />
Other cultures</p>
<p>Hongshan of Liaoning<br />
Jade carvings<br />
Ritual structures, such as life-size clay figure</p>
<p>Liangzhu<br />
Jade carvings, including ceremonial disks, axes, ritual tubes<br />
Utility unclear, but probably relate to early shamanism<br />
These objects are later seen in other cultures as well<br />
Social stratification: graves containing jade and ceramics, human sacrifice</p>
<p>Later developments, 3-2kya<br />
Neolithic cultures progressively became more similar<br />
Local versions of vessels such as cooking tripods that originated in the eastern coast<br />
Social hierarchy <br />
Elaborate graves<br />
E.g. chengzi and taosi<br />
Some grave goods include musical instruments (which becomes important in B.A. rituals)<br />
Regional differences remained<br />
Longshan improved upon the Dawenkou ceramic technologies, and devised eggshell-thin potteries<br />
High-status objects<br />
Transition<br />
Evidence of early oracle bones found in Longshan sites<br />
Life becoming more violent <br />
larger and more spearheads and arrowheads, and rammed-earth walls appear<br />
well shaft filled with bodies<br />
victims of raid<br />
small metal artefacts; not yet casted for vessels</p>
