3) Perraudin presented to Ignace Venetz (engineer, published results comparing moraine in the south vs moraine on current glaciers), Venetz believed it after some time. No one believed Venetz<br />

<li>claimed it would be possible to calculate the amount of sunlight reaching the earth at any time</li>
<li>teamed up with Koppen, a climeatologist. they claimed that it is the decrease in summer, not winter, radiation that caused an ice age. this is cuz the glaciers wouldn't melt as much, making the annual snow budget positive, learning to glacial expansion, whereas decrease in winter radiation doesn't have much of an effect, because it is already cold enough for snow</li>
<li>mil's curves of radiation matched with ice ages geological evidence</li>
<li>high latitudes are governed by the 41,000 yr tilt cycle, while low latitudes are governed by 22,000 yr precession cycle</li>
<li>accomplished 4 objectives: 1) geometry of each planets orbit and how that geometry has evolved 2) how much solar radiation strikes the surface of each planet during each season at each latitude 3) effect of latitude on radiation 4) calculate how much ice sheets would respond to change in solar radiation</li>

<li>Kukla went back to irregular alpine terraces discovered by Penck</li>
<li>Kukla proved Penck and Bruckner were wrong, and therefore Koppen and Wegner who confirmed Milankovitch were also wrong</li>
<li>Conclusion: major ice ages of the Pleistocene were spaced about 100,000 rs apart, developed slowly, termined abruptly.</li>

<ul>
<li>Mesolella @ Brown University updated Mil's theory to account for 100,000 yr cycle</li>
<li>"intensity of radiation during a season is largely controlled by precession cycle  and the amplitude is proportional to eccentricity, …</li>
<li>".. when orbit is unusually elongate, the contrast between seasons is greater. so if temp is critical to expansion or retraction of ice sheets, then 100,000 yr cycle must be reflected in record"</li>
<li>Mesolla said summer was responsible. Kukla said winter was responsible.</li>

<li>with time scale fixed from magnetic reversals, and paleontological techniques available to track ocean currents and estimate ocean temps, deep-sea cores were instruments for monitoring global climate</li>
<li>if time scale could be adapted to the Brunhes Epoch, then definitive test could be made agasint milankovitch theory</li>

<li>a dude named Shackleton and Opdyke sequences 19 isotopic stages within then 700,000 yr Brunhes Epoch</li>
<li>spectral analysis showed that 40,000 yr cycle was dominant on Emiliani's isotopic curve - this was the dominant climatic pulse</li>
<li>Imbrie showed that 100,000 year cycle was dominant and two smaller peaks indicating cycles of 40k and 20k years long</li>
