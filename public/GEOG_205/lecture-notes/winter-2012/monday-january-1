<p>Assignment 1</p>
<p>Ice Age Theory, The Players and The Proof (Part 2)</p>
<p>Recap of Ice Age Theory Players<br />
•   Jean-Pierre Parraudin: Swiss mountain guide; figured out the weight of the glaciers called the striations on the rocks; recognized because on contemporary glacial recession<br />
•   Ignace Venetz: characterized all of the glacier movements; realized it was all of the valleys near where he lived in Switzerland which the glaciers had once occupied<br />
•   Jean de Charpentier: did not believe him; when Venetz told him then he started to think about it more seriously; classified and organized all of the evidence for Ice Age Theory<br />
•   James and Archibald Geikie: brothers; Scottish geologists; James did not believe Lyell’s theory of tectonic uplift cause of the ice age (happens over millions of years); will talk about Archibald today<br />
•   Know these people generally well, do not need to know AS well<br />
•   Know their contribution and their relation to each other</p>
<p>Recap of Astronomical Thory<br />
•   11 000 years ago when the Earth is in the same spot we were having summer; now we have winter<br />
•   The axis is spinning – takes 21 and 26 000 years to make one complete revolution<br />
•   Half way through that cycle it will be tilted the other way<br />
•   1. Precession of the Equinox: Timing of the equinox along Earth’s axis (equal daylight and darkness around all of the earth)<br />
•   2. Eccentricity: 100 000 – 400 000 years (Parihelion: the point at which the Earth is closest to the sun; Aphelion: when Earth is furthest to the sun)<br />
•   Axial tilt: how much Earth leans relative to the vertical<br />
•   Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn: Shift with axial tilt, equal to axial tilt; lines of latitude</p>
<p>Josph Adhemar<br />
•   Proposed that variations in the precession caused ice age<br />
•   Precession affects Northern and Southern hemisphere in opposite manner<br />
•   1842: Ice age theory was not widely accepted yet<br />
•   French mathematician<br />
•   When a hemisphere had a longer winter, it would experience an ice age<br />
•   Used the Antarctic Ice Sheet as evidence<br />
•   Went on to say this had a force that could pull water from the northern oceans to the southern and create a bulge <br />
•   When this ice age ended in the S. Hemisphere, it would create a huge ice laden wave that would go north and engulf the lab<br />
•   After 11 000 years the ice age switches to the other hemisphere<br />
•   Claimed this was based on the amount of daylight</p>
<p>•   Average amount of daylight does not control temperature<br />
•   Temperature controlled by energy coming in from the sunlight<br />
•   Radiation balance</p>
<p>James Croll<br />
•   Thought extra cold winter would cause this to start because more snow would accumulate – happens year after year<br />
•   Precession and Eccentricity <br />
•   Plotted curve that showed changes in earth’s orbit prior 3 million years<br />
•   Deduced that ice ages occurred at times when Earth’s path was more elliptical (oval)<br />
•   Eccentricity represents amount of radiation received by Earth each season<br />
•   If winter occurs when Earth is close to the sun, winter is warmer and there will be no ice age<br />
•   Northern Hemisphere is pointing to the sun = no ice age (increased radiation)<br />
•   His theory could be tested by comparing geological information with his astronomical theory</p>
<p>Archibald <br />
•   Gave Croll job at Geological Survey of Scotland<br />
•   This book got the debate going again for 30 years<br />
•   Brothers came out in support of his theory<br />
•   Geologsts wanted to see if glaciation occurred in tandom – this would disprove Croll’s theory<br />
•   </p>
<p>Milutan Milkanovitch<br />
•   Combined all three aspects<br />
•   Summer in the northern, high latitudes was the critical season<br />
•   Differed because the other two said it was winter<br />
•   How much solar radiation strikes the planet at each season, at each latitude<br />
•   Showed climate affects variation in angle of tilt was more important than Croll had suggested<br />
•   Matheamatical calculations stronimical variations were sufficnet to produce ice ages<br />
•   55, 60, 65 lines of latitude: calculated incoming radiation<br />
•   Did calculations for 100 days from morning until night<br />
•   Figure 24 in Slides<br />
•   Graph aligned well with german Geographers graph 15 years earlier, terracing on the rivers<br />
•   The til at each terreace would be progressively older<br />
•   If this was an ice age, how would a mollusk grow here?<br />
