        <p>Lecture Feb 10 – movie The Little Ice Age</p>
<p>The little ice age<br />
Could it occur again?<br />
Summer of 1683- a monster approaches<br />
A band of priests set out to fight it –a huge glacier/river of ice quickly engulfing the villages and farmlands<br />
The glaciers are possessed by the devil, so they sprinkle it with holy water<br />
Less pronounced than the last ice age, when 30% of earth was covered in ice<br />
The little ice age was a 2-3 degree decrease in temp<br />
A period of very volatile climate shifts, unpredictable</p>
<p>It reshaped the world<br />
New york harbour froze and eskimos could reach Ireland<br />
Huge French famines leading to the revolution<br />
The exact cause is unknown, but it gives us perspective on what could occur<br />
Shows us that our climate CAN be changed</p>
<p>Sediment cores from the sea floor are drilled to find fossilized remains<br />
Based on the favorable habitat of a given species, their presence determines the temp in that time period</p>
<p>Descended in 1300 during the era of feudalism – rise of urban centers and the catholic church<br />
It was the little climate optimum/the medieval warming period<br />
Agriculture prospered and reduced stagnant water reduces malaria<br />
Architecture prospered due to over all human prosper<br />
Even in the best of times medieval peasants lived on the edge of doom<br />
The English ‘frost fares’ </p>
<p>In the 14th century a catastrophic occurrence- 1315 a dramatic change in weather. It rained continuously, washing away many crops. For 5 years<br />
Throughout Europe. The great famine. Massive crime and grave robbing.</p>
<p>Cereals were well grown during the medieval warm period but their height made them vulnerable during the little ice age – century’s of crop failure. <br />
People more often died of famine related diseases – huge outbreaks of bubonic plague. (rats, infected masses)<br />
1563 – burning of witched<br />
witches were blamed by the church for the climate change</p>
<p>the most vulnerable people were the swaggin vikings<br />
the vanguard, how had terrorized Europe, traveled to the new world 500 yrs before Columbus. They settled in Greenland during the warm period. <br />
They were hit so hard by the ice age that their crops and livestock dies. They had to rely on sea food. <br />
They were cut off from the home country due to the icy water<br />
The vikings chose to ignore inuit survival tactics </p>
<p>The little ice age had a very small reduction in solar radiation (half a percent)<br />
Ice cores of the poles show that 3 explosive volcanic eruptions occurred<br />
Oceanic heat currents were disrupted by a flood of fresh water from the melt of arctic ice during the warming period.</p>
<p>Agriculture was developed to resist the cold was developed- less cereals and more integrated farming including livestock (fertilizing manure) and resistant squashes<br />
Europeans would not eat potatoes- b/c of the poisonous leaves –the church marked them as being a sin to eat <br />
During the 30yrs war standing crops were burned.<br />
Underground potatoes were protected and saved thousands.<br />
However the French refused the potato, despite the king’s encouragement- living on the constant brink of famine.<br />
The irish grew almost exclusively the ‘lumper’ potato, a robust but disease susceptible crop. During the irish potato famine their crops were iinfected, rendering them inedible and starving millions.</p>
<p>The stradivarius was created during the little ice age. They have almost perfect tone- why?<br />
During cool years tree rings are much denser rings due to slower growth.<br />
The cells in these rings act as sound chambers. The trees from the Italian alps grew in poor soil –enhancing the denseness of the wood.</p>
<p>The little ice age killed most wine grape crops –the southern Europe continues to produce wine, the northern produce hard liquor and beer. <br />
The alcoholic preference of the northern europeans was imported to the new world with them.</p>
<p>In 2001 a Lithuanian mass grave is unearthed by a construction crew. They are napoleon soldiers<br />
Thousands of them died/froze to death or died of starvation. <br />
The Delaware river was choked with ice –troops were threatened by them as boats were covered in ice. It took nine hours for the Americans to cross it. <br />
1815 – the eruption of the Krakatau caused the ‘year without a summer’<br />
multicoloured snow globally + dusty fog and heavy rain.<br />
During this year Frankenstein was written during a cold, enclosed winter.<br />
Riots and robbing for food. Mass exodus to north America. <br />
New England too had to summer. Snow in june, persisting throughout the summer. Cattle froze to death and crops were destroyed.</p>
<p>The little ice age ended due to another oscillation in the oceans conveyer belt. <br />
Will an ice age occur again?<br />
Currently fresh water melting from northern ice, due to global warming, threatens the delicate balance of our planet’s climate.  </p>
