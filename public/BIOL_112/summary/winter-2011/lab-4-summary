        <p>Summary of Lab 4 for <a href="/BIOL_112/winter-2011">BIOL 112 (Winter 2011)</a>. Week of Jan 31, 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Macromolecules</strong>: starch and cellulose<br />
<strong>Enzymes</strong>: salivary amylase and succinate dehydrogenase</p>
<h2 class="header"><i>1</i>Introduction to biochemistry<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-biochemistry" name="introduction-to-biochemistry">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Chemical reactions catalysed by specific proteins<ul>
<li>Catalysts influence rate of reation, recovered unchanged</li>
<li>Each enzyme has its own particular substrate (substance upon which it acts)</li>
<li>Has an active site - arranged geometrically to bind only to specific types of molecules</li>
<li>Active site gives the properties of specificity and catalysis</li>
<li>Changing the structure will cause it to lose catalytic properties (e.g. oboiling)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>2</i>Benedict's test<a class="headerlink" href="#benedicts-test" name="benedicts-test">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>To check for the presence of a reducing sugar<ul>
<li>If positive, will change colour from green to yellow to orange to red</li>
<li>Tests positive for glucose, but negative for sucrose (not a reducing sugar)</li>
<li>Sucrose: glucose and fructose, bonded so that the reducing ends of both are lost</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Molecules possessing aldehyde functional groups will test positive</li>
<li>Maltose and lactose will also test positive</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>3</i>Iodine test<a class="headerlink" href="#iodine-test" name="iodine-test">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>To check for the presence of starch</li>
<li>If positive, will turn blue/black/purple</li>
<li>Positive for starch solution, negative for cotton (because it's just cellulose)</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>4</i>Starch and cellulose<a class="headerlink" href="#starch-and-cellulose" name="starch-and-cellulose">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Macromolecules: carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids</li>
<li>Each: polymers</li>
<li>Carbohydrates: derived during photosynthesis from carbon dioxide and water<ul>
<li>Examples: sugar, starch (grains, seeds etc), cellulose (wood)</li>
<li>Three types: monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides</li>
<li>Classified based on the number of simple sugar molecules linked together</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Starch and cellulose both polysaccharides, made up of many glucose molecules linked together<ul>
<li>But in starch, alpha bonds, so the same orientation</li>
<li>Cellulose, beta bonds, orientation varies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Experiment: learn about the sub-units of the two polysaccharides, as well as specificity of enzyme action</li>
<li>Procedure for starch:<ul>
<li>8 test tubes</li>
<li>4 water, 2 HCl, 2 amylase</li>
<li>For two water, benedict/iodine test immediately</li>
<li>The other two water, 30 mins at 100 C, then tests</li>
<li>For the amylase, 45 mins at 37 C, then tests</li>
<li>For the HCl, 30 mins at 100 C, then tests</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Results for starch:<ul>
<li>Water + Benedict negative, because starch is not a reducing sugar by itself</li>
<li>Water + iodine test positive, because starch contains starch (...)</li>
<li>Amylase + benedict's test positive, because amylase COULD break down the starch into its subunits (glucose)</li>
<li>Amylase + iodine test negative, because it was broken down into glucose (i.e. not starch anymore)</li>
<li>HCl + benedict's test positive, because the HCl and heat broke it down into its glucose subunits</li>
<li>HCl + iodine test negative, for the above reason</li>
<li>water + 30 mins at 100 C + benedict = negative, that was not enough to break it down</li>
<li>^ with iodine = positive, see above</li>
<li>Basically, Benedict tests if it's broken down, iodine confirms that it's not</li>
<li>Note: neutralise the acid with sodium hydroxide first, because Benedict's test is always negative in an acidic solution</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedure for cellulose:<ul>
<li>8 test tubes, 4 water, 2 sulfuric acid, 2 amylase</li>
<li>Pretty much the same as with starch</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Results for cellulose:<ul>
<li>Water + benedict, negative because it was not broken down</li>
<li>All the iodine tests were negative because there is no starch ...</li>
<li>Amylase + benedict = negative because amylase can't break down the beta bonds in cellulose</li>
<li>sulfuric acid + benedict = POSITIVE because acid and high heat can always break the bonds</li>
<li>water + heat + benedict = negative, not enough to break the bond</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What we learned from these experiments etc<ul>
<li>both composed of glucose subunits</li>
<li>Amylase could only break starch and not cellulose into its subunits<ul>
<li>Glucose monomers joined in same direction; orientations switch in cellulose</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Specificity of enzyme action - enzymes specific to substrates and reaction<ul>
<li>In this case, amylase was specific breaking down the alpha bonds in starch</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>5</i>Enzymes<a class="headerlink" href="#enzymes" name="enzymes">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Dehydrogenation in living cells: hydrogen removed from molecules<ul>
<li>Dehydrogenases - enzymes that influence this</li>
<li>Hydrogen transferred from one hydrogen carrier to another</li>
<li>Eventually combines with oxygen to form water</li>
<li>If an artificial hydrogen carrier is introduced, hydrogen may be diverted to it instead of oxygen</li>
<li>For example, the blue dye DCIP ... which incidentally becomes colourless when it accepts hydrogen</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The enzyme succinate dehydrogenase, from the mitochondria of plant and animal cells, catalyses a step in the Krebs cycle<ul>
<li>Succinate is dehydrogenated to form fumarate; usually, a derivative of riboflavin accepts the hydrogen that is removed</li>
<li>But if we add DCIP, it will take up the hydrogen, and so we can measure the rate of the dehydrogenation by the rate of colourlessness of DCIP</li>
<li>Note: this reaction must be done in the absence of oxygen, otherwise DCIP-H2 will spontaneously react with oxygen to form water and blue dye again<ul>
<li>We used azide to block electron transfer to oxygen</li>
<li>Essentially, it binds with oxygen, so it can't react with the hydrogen</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Competitive inhibitors: chemically resemble the natural substrate<ul>
<li>In this case, malonate resembles succinate</li>
<li>So if we add enough malonate, it will complex with the enzyme, so there is none left to catalyse the succinate</li>
<li>Note: succinate deyhydrogenase is unable to dehydrogenate it due to valence difficulties</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spectrophotometry: measure light absorption at a given wavelength of light<ul>
<li>Used in the visible or UV light range</li>
<li>As DCIP becomes colourless, light absorption will increase as the reaction proceeds</li>
<li>Thus the rate of the dehydrogenase reaction is proportional to the rate of change of absorbance</li>
<li>% Transmittance: the proportion of light passing through the sample<ul>
<li>Not a direct measure of concentration, however</li>
<li>Because the molecules shade each other etc</li>
<li>However, we can use transmittance to get absorbance, which is equal to &lt;math&gt;\log \left ( \frac{1}{T} \right )&lt;/math&gt;</li>
<li>Absorbance IS a direct measure of solute concentration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We have to use a blank solution (everything but the dye) for each test tube<ul>
<li>Place the blank solution in, adjust the knobs to 100% transmittance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedure: 6 tubes + 3 blank tubes<ul>
<li>Test tube 1: everything but malonate, 0.3 mL mitochondria (so very little enzyme)</li>
<li>Test tube 2: same as above but more mitochondria (0.9mL)</li>
<li>Test tube 3: Same as above, medium amount of mitochondria (0.6 mL)</li>
<li>Test tube 4: Added a bit of malonate</li>
<li>Test tube 5: No succinate</li>
<li>Test tube 6: boiled mitochondria</li>
<li>Note: amount of azide and DCIP and succinate same for all (except when succinate was not used)</li>
<li>Amount of assay varied depending on how much mitochondria was there (for a constant total volume I guess)</li>
<li>Had to vortex the mitochondria suspension each time, then add parafilm and invert</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Results:<ul>
<li>Test tube 1: Slow reaction due to not enough enzyme etc</li>
<li>Test tube 2: much faster reaction - more enzyme (although it tapered off near the end, as succinate was running out)</li>
<li>Test tube 3: medium rate of reaction</li>
<li>Test tube 4: Much less reaction due to the competitive inhibitor (but still some - not enough malonate I guess)</li>
<li>Test tube 5: No succinate led to little to no reaction (if there was some succinate in the mitochondria suspension there may have been some reaction)</li>
<li>Test tube 6: enzyme was denatured for the most part, so little to no reaction (incomplete denaturation would lead to some reaction)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Summary:<ul>
<li>Initial rate of reaction proportional to enzyme concentration (but levels off over time)</li>
<li>Malonate inhibited the reaction, but still some change in absorbance because there was not enough malonate to inhibit it completely</li>
<li>Whatever</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
