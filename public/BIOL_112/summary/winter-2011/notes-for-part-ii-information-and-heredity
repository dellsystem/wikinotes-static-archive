        <p><a href="/BIOL_112/winter-2011">BIOL 112 (Winter 2011)</a> notes for <strong>Part II: Information and Heredity</strong> (Professor Dent's section). From February 16, 2011 to whenever the semester ends.</p>
<h2 class="header"><i>1</i>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" name="introduction">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Prof does not have office hours - email him to schedule an appointment, or just email him</li>
<li>3 sets of practice problems - do them</li>
<li>A nice story about a central Asian monk named Temujin around 1220 AD and unknown paternity<ul>
<li>(aka Genghis Khan)</li>
<li>Had to give his land to his son, but paternity issues, some sort of controversy</li>
<li>Sort of illustrates the concept of heredity, which is what we're learning now</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The mystery of heredity<ul>
<li>All organisms come from other organisms (except for the base case, which ostensibly was abiogenesis)</li>
<li>All organisms resemble their parents</li>
<li>Siblings are not identical</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The magic that is conception<ul>
<li>An egg becomes fertilised and undergoes cleavage (cell division) until eventually you get an organism</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>2</i>Cell cycle<a class="headerlink" href="#cell-cycle" name="cell-cycle">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>All organisms consist of cells, which divide to produce new cells</li>
<li>Higher organisms fuse their cells (sperm and ova) to produce a new organism</li>
<li>Cell division results in more cells, etc</li>
<li>Dividing cells devote a lot of resources to segregating chromosomes<ul>
<li>i.e. organising them in a line, pulling them apart so that each cell gets an equal number of chromosomes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chromosome: single string of DNA<ul>
<li>Circular: bacteria</li>
<li>Linear: most other organisms (including us)</li>
<li>When a cell is ready to divide, chromosomes condense, associate with proteins (e.g. histones)</li>
<li>Combination of DNA + proteins = chromatin which is dark and easy to see</li>
<li>Normal DNA is difficult to see under a light microscope, but when it's ready to divide, easier to see</li>
<li>The DNA double helix wraps around histones, which wraps around other proteins, etc ... all bunched together</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Karyotype: organising and identifying chromosomes<ul>
<li>Take a cell that is getting ready to divide</li>
<li>Flatten it with glass (mitotic squash?)</li>
<li>Stain it with a dye, gives them stripes; take a picture and cut them up etc</li>
<li>Shows that chromosomes come in pairs - homologs (except for the sex chromosomes, which don't look like each other)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The number of chromosomes is characteristic of a specie (with some exceptions)<ul>
<li>Humans typically have 46, roundworms have 2, pigeons 80</li>
<li>Doesn't really correspond to complexity or anything</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Just before cell division, each chromosome has been replicated once to produce two chromatids (at the top of the chromosome)<ul>
<li>Two chromatids for each chromosome in a pair, held together by a centromere</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Normally a chromosome is a single piece of DNA<ul>
<li>But when we look at a karyotype, we are seeing two pieces of DNA - the two chromatids, bound by a centromere</li>
<li>We call these <strong>mitotic chromosomes</strong> to show that they are a special case</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Segregating chromosomes is exacting: a cell needs to give each daughter cell the right number of chromosomes<ul>
<li>With random segregation, only half the time does each daughter get one chromatid (the right result)</li>
<li>So there needs to be some sort of mechanism that ensures that the right result is enforced every time</li>
<li>Organisms need at least one of each chromosome, and typically exactly one<ul>
<li>more can cause problems - ex, Down syndrome - an extra chromosome 21 (which is incidentally the smallest chromosome)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So the chromosomes must obviously be duplicated BEFORE the cell divides</li>
<li>NOW THE ACTUAL CELL CYCLE (steps of cell division)<ul>
<li>Chromosome (DNA) replication: S phase</li>
<li>Mitosis (M) somatic cells divide into daughter cells, each of which inherits one copy of each chromosome</li>
<li>OR Meiosis (M) for germ lines (gametes) - non-identical copies, creating daughter cells that have one of each homolog</li>
<li>Cytokinesis: dividing the cytoplasm in two (optional)</li>
<li>Starts with Gap 1 (G1) - cell is growing, accumulating resources it needs to divide</li>
<li>Then it duplicates its chromosomes - DNA synthesis (S phase)</li>
<li>Gap 2 (G2) - another rest phase, preparing to divide</li>
<li>Then it undergoes mitosis (M), and the daughter cells go through the cell cycle again</li>
<li>To ensure that this occurs in order, there is a checkpoint between each phase</li>
<li>From S to G2, cell checks that each chromatid has been duplicated</li>
<li>What evidence of this checkpoint do we have?<ul>
<li>Drug: hydroxyurea, blocks chrosome replication</li>
<li>So cell division is put on hiatus indefinitely</li>
<li>Another: caffeine, which disables the checkpoint</li>
<li>This is usually not a problem, as chromosome replication occurs without problems</li>
<li>However, if you both block chromosome replication AND disable the checkpoint, you have problems</li>
<li>Because the cell will attempt to continue to the mitosis stage, but will find that it's not able to divide properly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cell cycle tightly regulated to ensure that, in particular, each cell gets the right number of chromosomes<ul>
<li>Diagram later maybe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More on the G1 to S transition:<ul>
<li>There is a protein called Cdk4, which is always present during the cell cycle but doesn't really do anything</li>
<li>But then it associates with another protein called Cyclin D, which is only produced during S phase</li>
<li>This complex interacts with other proteins to say that the cell is ready to go into S</li>
<li>Cyclin is degraded, Cdk4 is released (no longer functional)</li>
<li>So this activity of proteins tells the cell what cycle it's in, when to start transition</li>
<li>Although cyclins and cdks are involved in all parts of the cell cycle, important in different transitions, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How do cells know when to divide?<ul>
<li>Most somatic cells not dividing - arrested in the G1 phase of the cycle</li>
<li>Often waiting for signals from other cells to tell them to divide</li>
<li>For example, cells in the immune system: not usually dividing, but when there is an infection, they start dividing<ul>
<li>A cell called a macrophage identifies a virus, sends a chemical signal to T-cells telling them to start dividing, and about the infection</li>
<li>So T-cells don't start dividing until they get a signal from a macrophage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unregulated division of cells &amp;rarr; cancer</li>
<li>If the G1 to S checkpoint is defective, a cell can divide in an unregulated manner (i.e. dividing when it shouldn't be)<ul>
<li>For example, if cyclin E is always active or overabundant, a cell will repeatedly divide &amp;rarr; cancer</li>
<li>If we can understand how signals regulate the cell cycle, we might be able to design drugs to interfere with these signals</li>
<li>(And thus fight cancer)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>2.1</i>Mitosis<a class="headerlink" href="#mitosis" name="mitosis">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Although the process of dividing cells randomly and hoping that each half gets the same stuff works for things like mitochondria and ribosomes etc, doesn't work for chromosomes</li>
<li>Cell can regulate chromosome duplication, to ensure proper segregation (unlikely to happen randomly)<ul>
<li>Mitotic chromosome: the kind we're familiar with, two sister chromatids united by a centromere (only happens during mitosis, usually a messy ball - not yet condensed)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mitotic spindle: mechanism for this</li>
<li>Prophase: centrosomes duplicate, migrate to opposite ends of nucleus, chromosomes start to condense</li>
<li>Prometaphase: nuclear envelope breaks down, microtubules from spindles (formed from centrosomes, at poles) can interact with chromosomes, bind to each other<ul>
<li>Microtubules are growing and trying to interact with chromosomes, unstably and randomly sampling space</li>
<li>Because centrosomes don't know where chromosomes are, just looking for them with microtubules</li>
<li>Each kinetochore is given a geometry so that two kinetochore microtubules from the same spindle can't get both chromatids</li>
<li>Basically, kinetochores are the things that the microtubules can attach to, to latch onto the chromatids</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Metaphase: all the chromosomes are lined up in the middle between the poles (equatorially), attached chromatid to centrosome (metaphase plate)<ul>
<li>Chromatids must be paired and kept together until it is time to segregate</li>
<li>Checkpoint to make sure that all chromosomes are attached to microtubules and on opposite centrosomes, before continuing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anaphase: centrosomes break down, so sister chromatids no longer attached, microtubules pull chromatids apart</li>
<li>Telophase: shortly before the cell actually divides, equal number of chromosomes in each half</li>
<li>Cytokinesis: only in plants, for dividing the cell<ul>
<li>Vesicles between the cells are added, fuse to become the cell plate (cell wall)</li>
<li>In animals, purse string method - actin and myosin constrict, to pinch and divide the cell</li>
<li>Note that cytokinesis does not always happen - some cells have multiple nuclei per cell</li>
<li>Example, cardiac tissue is multinucleated (syncytial) - mitosis without cytokinesis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Errors: if one chromosome, say, goes to the wrong side, such that one daughter cell has 2 copies of one chromosome and the other has 0, both will die</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>2.2</i>Meiosis<a class="headerlink" href="#meiosis" name="meiosis">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Sex: mixing the genetic material of two organisms, for organisms that are different from you and thus may be better adapted</li>
<li>First, need to reduce the number of chromosomes by half</li>
<li>Ploidy - the number of sets of chromosomes containing exactly one of each homolog<ul>
<li>Haploid, diploid, triploid, tetraploid, pentaploid etc</li>
<li>Somatic cells are diploid, so gametes must be haploid</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meiosis: process by which haploid cells are made, much like mitosis<ul>
<li>Meiosis I: reduction division<ul>
<li>Early prophase I, chromosomes condense, move apart</li>
<li>Mid-prophase I: chromosomes are condensed, have been duplicated (so 2 of each chromosome, 4 of each chromatid)</li>
<li>Late prophase I - prometaphase, little pieces of homologous chromatids start exchanging DNA (chiasma or recombination)</li>
<li>Metaphase I: all lined up, except two columns, sort of, in the middle (so pairs of homologues lined up)</li>
<li>Checkpoint before anaphase</li>
<li>Anaphase I: homologues separate (chromatids stay stuck together), half on each side</li>
<li>Telophase I, ^</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, the process is not complete - still too many chromatids (diploid)</li>
<li>So then we have meiosis II: equatorial division, similar to mitosis<ul>
<li>Form a spindle, microtubules grab chromatids, so you end up with four haploid cells</li>
<li>Prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, telophase II etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While mitosis can be quick, cells can arrest in meiosis for a long time<ul>
<li>E.g. ova, produced by human females; arrest, wait until they're fertilised</li>
<li>However, problems with this: Down's syndrome, happens more often with older owmen<ul>
<li>A problem with meiosis I; two homologues in one cell, so daughter cells (from meiosis II) still have 2 of each chromosome (21 in this case)</li>
<li>The older the mother, the longer the egg has been "sitting around", in an arrested stage</li>
<li>And the longer the egg has been sitting around the greater the chance of imperfect duplication</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>2.3</i>Ploidy<a class="headerlink" href="#ploidy" name="ploidy">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>We're diplontic life organisms - mostly diploid, small haploid portion (fertilisation etc)</li>
<li>But there are also haplontic organisms, e.g. algae - almost completely haploid, gametes fuse, undergo meiosis immediately (so briefly diploid I guess)</li>
<li>It's not the absolute number of chromosomes that's important, but rather the ratio that matters</li>
<li>As long as the ratio is constant (e.g. 3 chromosome 1s, 3 chromosomes 3)</li>
<li>However, odd ploidys tend to be sterile (one daughter cell will have more chromosomes than the other etc)</li>
<li>Trisomy: genetic anomaly, three copies (instead of two) of a particular chromosome (type of aneuploidy)</li>
<li>You can also have triploids (sterile though) and tetraploids or even more<ul>
<li>For example, store-bought strawberries ... can be octoploids (makes them bigger, still viable and fertile)</li>
<li>Another example: frog in South Africa, at one point, evolved to be tetraploid rather than diploid (whole new species); similar but larger than original</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>3</i>Genetics: Mendel<a class="headerlink" href="#genetics-mendel" name="genetics-mendel">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Gregor Mendel: Austrian(/Australian) monk, really cool guy and doesn't afraid of anything<ul>
<li>Pea plant experiment</li>
<li>Tried to explain why for a given character, offspring share traits with their parents, but siblings' traits not necessarily identical</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Continuous variation: height, skin colour, etc<ul>
<li>Leads to blended inheritance usu</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discrete variation: only a few possible traits for a given character<ul>
<li>Example: pea flower colour or mouse fur colour</li>
<li>What Mendel focused on (pea plant colours)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Used true-breeding strains (e.g. round pea, only gives round peas when fertilising itself)</li>
<li>True-breeding round + true-breeding wrinkled = only round in F1<ul>
<li>But F2 progeny, 1/4 wrinkled, omg genetics</li>
<li>Same sort of thing happens with many other traits that exhibit complete dominance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vocab terms: genes, alleles (different possibilitiesfor a gene), hetero/homozygous</li>
<li>Punnett squares etc</li>
<li>Stochastic process, follows laws of probability, pretty straightforward</li>
<li>Genotype: set of alleles; phenotype: set of traits<ul>
<li>Genotype uniquely determines phenotype, but phenotypes can be the result of many different genotypes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alleles of the same gene segregate independently; same for alleles of different genes (law of independent assortment)<ul>
<li>Example: SSYY x ssyy</li>
<li>F1: All SsYy</li>
<li>F2: 9:3:3:1 (S-Y-:ssY-:S-yy:ssyy)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Note on Punnett squares: if you have n genes, <span>$2^n$</span> genotypes<ul>
<li>Some gametes may have the same genotype; still have to include them</li>
<li>If you have more than 3 genes, just use probabiddy, not Punnett squares</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conclusion: heredity inherited through discrete units (alleles)</li>
<li>Mendel's discoveries were ignored until the discovery of chromosomes (discrete structures that could be responsible for this phenomenon)<ul>
<li>If genes are on different chromosomes, then they can segregate independently during meiosis (arrangement across metaphase plate)</li>
<li>However, they don't HAVE to be on different chromosomes - chiasma (genetic recombination) during meiosis (?)</li>
<li>But the law apparently only applies to genes on different chromosomes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Usually can't see alleles, but in the case of sex chromosomes, you sort of can (XX vs. XY)<ul>
<li>Y is kind of dominant - XXY is male, X is female</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Red-green quarter blindness: sex-linked (X), recessive<ul>
<li>Colour-blind females have affected fathers</li>
<li>Colour-blind males usually have unaffected parents (colour-blind dad = red herring; colour-blind mother = unlikely)</li>
<li>There is no colour-blind gene on the Y chromosome - too small I guess</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wild-type (predominant, &gt;99%) vs. mutant alleles (sometimes purposely-induced mutations)<ul>
<li>Polymorphic alleles - &gt; 1% of population</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Autosomes (non-sex chromosomes) and allosomes (sex chromosomes)</li>
<li>For genes on the same chromosome:<ul>
<li>Experiment with fruit flies, either two genes are on the same chromosome or not</li>
<li>Results: the genes are on the same</li>
<li>Draw the Punnett squares for both possibilities, results matched the same-chromosome situation</li>
<li>Also tells you how the genes are arranged on the chromosomes (e.g. both dominants on the same chromosome)</li>
<li>HOWEVER, you also get some evidence that the genes are NOT linked to the same chromosome</li>
<li>Of course this is due to genetic recombination (crossover etc)<ul>
<li>Recombination occurs at random points on the chromosome</li>
<li>So the probability or rate of recombination occurring between two genes depends on their distance from each other</li>
<li>The further apart two genes are, the more likely that they will be separated</li>
<li>So measuring recombination rate can tell you about the distance between two genes on a chromosome</li>
<li>This distance is measured in centiMorgans (cM) = number of recombinations / number of total progeny</li>
<li>Example: if black is 16.6 cM from vestigial and vestigial is 12 cM from curly ...</li>
<li>Then you don't know how far black is from curly, could be either 28.6 or 4.6</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>3.1</i>Continuous variation<a class="headerlink" href="#continuous-variation" name="continuous-variation">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Results from having many genes determine each trait, and many alleles for each gene</li>
<li>Example, snapdragons and colour (red + white = pink, intermediate phenotype), incomplete dominance<ul>
<li>Reason: white does not have gene for producing red pigment</li>
<li>Pink is heterozygous, so produces only half the amount of red pigment, so pink</li>
<li>But if you had many alleles and many genes you can get a true range of phenotypes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Although not exactly continuous variation, it does illustrate intermediate phenotypes (although there is only one)</li>
<li>Example in humans: allelic series and Alzheimer's disease<ul>
<li>Different allelic combinations result in different risks of developing the disease</li>
<li>So the alleles are working additively</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can also have multiple genes affecting a phenotypic trait (multigenic or polygenic)<ul>
<li>Example: heart disease, many genes working additively</li>
<li>Each allele acts as a single Mendelian trait, but their sum gives the actual result</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Epistasis: interactions between alelles of different genes<ul>
<li>Example: fur-colour in mice, not a single locus - two genes determine, discrete trait</li>
<li>If you have two recessive alleles for the albino locus, you are albino</li>
<li>But if you don't have two recessive alleles for the albino locus, you produce pigment</li>
<li>But the pigment colour is determined by another gene, Agouti - either brown if you have bb or black if you have B-</li>
<li>So mice can only be either brown or black or white</li>
<li>In other words, the genes assort independently, but the ratio is not 9:3:3:1 because of interactions (epistatis)</li>
<li>Instead, 9:4:3</li>
<li>Epistasis often results from genes involved in different steps along the same pathway or process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Environmental contribution to phenotype:<ul>
<li>Penetrance: percentage of individuals with a given genotype showing a certain phenotype</li>
<li>Expressivity: the degree to which a phenotype is expressed</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>4</i>DNA and heredity<a class="headerlink" href="#dna-and-heredity" name="dna-and-heredity">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Chromosomes: physical things that carry heredity, and they are made of DNA OMG</li>
<li>How to get the stuff that chromosomes are made from: purify them, assay the components<ul>
<li>Assay: just a way of measuring something</li>
<li>For example, an allergy skin test assay, to find out what substance is causing allergic reactions</li>
<li>Separate the components, test them one at a time</li>
<li>For DNA: grind up any living organism<ul>
<li>Use an organic solvent to extract lipids and proteins (e.g. phenol)</li>
<li>Precipitate with ethanol, and you get just DNA</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now do the assay test<ul>
<li>Hypothetically, get some porcupine DNA, dip a cat into the DNA, should result in a pet porcupine RIGHT?</li>
<li>No</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>But you can actually do something similar, with bacteria (discovered by Frederick Griffith)</li>
<li>Can an extract from dead bacterial cells genetically transform living bacterial cells?</li>
<li>S strains and R strains of bacteria, S is deadly, R is harmless (when injected into a mouse)<ul>
<li>So take the S strain, heat it up so that the bacteria are dead, inject in mouse - harmless</li>
<li>However, if you kill the S strain, mix it with the R strain, and inject it into the mouse, it will die</li>
<li>Essentially you have transformed the R strain into the deadly S strain, by mixing them (something transferred)</li>
<li>Transforming principle - hereditary</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Oswald Avery, simple experiment to identify the transforming principle - turned out to be DNA (not lipids carbs etc)</li>
<li>Another experiment on this done on viruses, which can also have DNA<ul>
<li>Specifically, bacteriophages which infect bacteria, inject something into the bacteria</li>
<li>Which causes more bacteriophage to be made within the bacterium</li>
<li>Bacteriophage have only DNA and proteins, so the Hershey-Chase experiment set out to show that it was DNA that was being injected</li>
<li>Done by labelling protein with radioactive sulfur and DNA with radioactive phosphate (has a phosphate backbone)</li>
<li>Then blend the mixture of phage and bacteria, so that the phage gets stripped off the top of bacteria</li>
<li>Locate the DNA after centrifuging - is it in the bacteria (pellet I think)? Or is it in the supernatant (liquid at top)</li>
<li>Shows you clearly that DNA is what is being injected</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>4.1</i>Structure of DNA<a class="headerlink" href="#structure-of-dna" name="structure-of-dna">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Nucleoitodes: base (4 different kinds) + sugar (deoxyribose) + phosphate, polymer backbone (ribose-phosphate-ribose)</li>
<li>5' phosphate at one end, 3' hydroxyl at the other end (so directionality)</li>
<li>Chargaff's rule: ratio of bases (A:T:G:C) specific to organisms (humans have a different ratio than corn etc)<ul>
<li>Chargaff's analysis also showed that the ratio of A:T is 1:1, same for C:G (so those are always paired)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>X-ray crystallography (diffraction etc, cool stuff)<ul>
<li>Showed that DNA consists of two strands, double helix, antiparallel (so each end has a 5' and a 3' end)</li>
<li>Phosphates probably on the outside</li>
<li>Watson and Crick put it all together for a good model of DNA</li>
<li>Minor groove: when backbones are close together; major groove: when they're far apart</li>
<li>DNA strands are the reverse complement to each other (opposite directions, and A-T, C-G)</li>
<li>The reason A-T and C-G are paired: natural affinity of bases<ul>
<li>A-T, form hydrogen bonds when they lie together in a plane with the backbone on the outside</li>
<li>C-G, form three hydrogen bonds (?) so these hydrogen bonds determines base pairing</li>
<li>Note: A, G are purines (large); T-C, pyrimidines (small bases), so no bulges; distance between two strands always the same</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RNA, another nucleotide, can also form complementary strands, with U instead of T</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Key to DNA: sequence of nucleotides not constrained by the structure; can accommodate any sequence<ul>
<li>Each strand has the same information as the other strand - so in a sense it's already replicated</li>
<li>But how does it actually replicate (to make children etc)</li>

<h3 class="header"><i>4.2</i>DNA replication<a class="headerlink" href="#dna-replication" name="dna-replication">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Original possibilities considered:<ul>
<li>Semi-conservative, two strands separate, new strand for each</li>
<li>Conservative, two strands separate, make copies, those copied strands join</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Experiment to determine what actually occurs (Meselson and Stahl):<ul>
<li>To distinguish between new and old DNA - N14, light DNA; N15, heavy DNA</li>
<li>Use a centrifuge to separate them</li>
<li>Procedure: grew bacteria in heavy DNA, allowed it to replicate, became lighter etc</li>
<li>After one generation, all the DNA migrated to the middle, suggesting that all the DNA is intermediately heavy</li>
<li>Also, adding a new light generation, etc</li>
<li>So this supports the semi-conservative model - each pair of strands is half new, half old</li>
<li>If replication were conservative, this experiment after two rounds would result in 1/4 heavy, 3/4 light<ul>
<li>Reason: the original would remain heavy, would make a new light strand after one replication</li>
<li>After the second round, the original would still be heavy, but the new ones would all be light</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Making DNA in a test tube:<ul>
<li>Triphosphate nucleotides</li>
<li>DNA polymerase (an enzyme)</li>
<li>DNA template (an old strand that can be duplicate), which must have ragged ends</li>
<li>Ragged ends: one of the strands sticks out, which acts as a template to stick a new base on</li>
<li>For example, if you have a G at a ragged end, you would add a C to it (formed from the materials)</li>
<li>This ragged end must be at the 3' end (so that you attach shit to the 3' base)</li>
<li>Indicates that the direction of polymerisation is 5' to 3' (so start make the 5' end first)</li>
<li>When in the lab, you create ragged ends by breaking up the DNA with phenol etc</li>
<li>But how does the cell make ragged ends (which it hates) and how does it pull them apart?<ul>
<li>Solution: enzyme called helicase, unwinds the DNA (pries them apart, like unzipping)</li>
<li>Enzyme called primase, creates fake ragged ends - creates a short RNA primer</li>
<li>Then the polymerase uses the primer as a 3' end</li>
<li>Leading strand (can follow the helicase) vs. lagging strand (has Okazaki fragments)</li>
<li>How exactly does this work? Ascertain this</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This bubble formation is not random, occurs at specific locations in DNA</li>
<li>For example, bacteria, circular chromosomes; creates two linked rings (which are then broken apart)</li>
<li>For our linear chromosomes, many different origins of replication, eventually the whole thing is replicated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Error correction mechanisms:<ul>
<li>DNA proofreading by DNA polymerase III<ul>
<li>Sometimes it can see when it made mistakes, go back, replace it with the right base</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mismatch repair<ul>
<li>If the new strand does not match the old, an enzyme will fix it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Excision repair: bases are damaged, will replace them<ul>
<li>Example: UV light produces thymine dimers, where thymine bases are bonded to each other</li>
<li>An enzyme can recognise this, will rip out the bases and replace them with good ones</li>
<li>Can repair single bases, multiple bases, etc</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>5</i>The genetic code<a class="headerlink" href="#the-genetic-code" name="the-genetic-code">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Key to DNA:<ul>
<li>DNA can accommodate any arbitrary sequence, which can encode information</li>
<li>Two strands encode the same information in complementary format - method for replication</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alkaptonurea: metabolic disease, urine turns black when exposed to air<ul>
<li>Garrod figured out that is a recessive hereditary trait (ran in the family etc)</li>
<li>Then deduced that it results from the absence of a specific enzyme</li>
<li>So the enzyme would normally convert a certain compound into another, but as that enzyme is missing ...</li>
<li>The compound remains in that format, and when oxidised, that compound turns black</li>
<li>Thus genes correspond to enzymes, or something</li>
<li>Another example of a gene in a pathway (first example: epistasis)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Experiment: Beadle and Tatum<ul>
<li>Show that genes determine enzymes in a biochemical pathway</li>
<li>Established: one enzyme, one gene, for a series of genes in a pathway<ul>
<li>We now know: one gene, one protein (so each gene encodes for a protein)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In this pathway, we have compound conversion: ornithine --&gt; citrulline --&gt; arginine (an essential amino acid)</li>
<li>So this pathway must be intact for organisms to grow etc</li>
<li>Method: put spores of each arg (mold) mutant strain in a medium with and without nutritional supplements<ul>
<li>Normally if you add the minimal number of nutrients, the wild-type can grow</li>
<li>But sometimes there are mutants that need additional supplements to grow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The wild-type: you can add ornithine, or citrulline, or arginine, and it will grow</li>
<li>One mutant type - will only grow if you add citrulline or arginine</li>
<li>Another mutant type - only on arginine, clearly missing an enzyme to convert shit into citrulline</li>
<li>So it was possible to identify a number of mutants, each one corresponding to a missing enzyme in the pathway</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RNA: ribonucleic acid, how information goes from the nucleus into the cytoplasm (where proteins are actually made)<ul>
<li>So DNA is converted into RNA, which carries information into cytoplasm</li>
<li>Ribosomes use this information to make proteins</li>
<li>So DNA information flows to DNA (replication), and also to RNA, then to proteins</li>
<li>Difference: uracil instead of thymine; has both hydroxyl groups on ribose (?)</li>
<li>So you can have these double-stranded hybrids of RNA and DNA</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Transcription: enzyme = RNA polymerase<ul>
<li>Enzyme unwinds the two strands of DNA</li>
<li>Starts making an RNA strand (5' to 3') complementary to ONE of the strands</li>
<li>Only goes a short distance - corresponding to how much information it needs</li>
<li>Then the RNA goes out of the nucleus, ribosomes grab onto it to make proteins</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fred Sanger - sequenced the first protein (insulin)<ul>
<li>Showed that a sequence of amino acids is characteristic of a protein</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>64 possible sequences, only 20 amino acids, so yeah some redundancy</li>
<li>Experiment to figure out which sequences encode for which amino acids:<ul>
<li>RNA with only one of: UUU, AAA, or CCC (repeated)</li>
<li>Conclusion: each triplet is mRNA for a different amino acid</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Gobind Khorana: AAGAAGAAG<ul>
<li>Some proteins were made of LysLysLys (amino acids)</li>
<li>Others, ArgArgArg ... others, GluGluGlu</li>
<li>Due to the three possible reading frames for any sequence of DNA</li>
<li>If you do enough experiments like that, you can figure out which amino acid each codon corresponds to</li>
<li>Methionine: AUG/ATG, start codon</li>
<li>Stop codon: TAG/TAA/TGA (or with U)</li>
<li>Code is degenerate: while DNA uniquely determines the amino acid sequence, the reverse is not true</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does the ribosome know how to interpret the RNA sequence?<ul>
<li>Unlike in DNA, where one strand has natural hydrogen bond affinity to the other strand, this is not true for ribosomes</li>
<li>No affinity of amino acids to specific codons in RNA</li>
<li>So there is another type of RNA - transfer RNA, has a 3' and 5' end, and has an anticodon<ul>
<li>The reverse complement of the codon that encodes for the amino acid</li>
<li>There is 1+ tRNA for each amino acid</li>
<li>So for CAT the tRNA would be GTA I guess</li>
<li>Each tRNA has a unique shape</li>
<li>So the tRNA binds to the mRNA, and the correct amino acid is on the tRNA (other side)</li>
<li>Which is how you get the amino acid, the amino acids join up etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does the cell know which amino acid to attach to a specific tRNA?<ul>
<li>Answer lies in the structure of the tRNA itself - shape, also tRNA synthase</li>
<li>Enzymes recognise specific tRNA and amino acids, attach them to each other</li>
<li>If you, say, converted an amino acid on tRNA to something else, the ribosome wouldn't know, would just blindly insert it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This code, shared by organisms ... evidence for a single common ancestor, presumably around 6000 years ago</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>5.1</i>Transcription and translation<a class="headerlink" href="#transcription-and-translation" name="transcription-and-translation">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Clicker question: if the enzymes for converting a precursor to ornithine and ornithine to citrulline were missing ...<ul>
<li>What would the neurospora grow on?</li>
<li>Answer: arginine or citrulline. Since citrulline can still be converted to arginine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One DNA strand has the same sequence as the mRNA (sense/coding strand)<ul>
<li>This is the strand we look at if we want to see what amino acids are being produced, etc (just change T to U)</li>
<li>The other one acts as the template - the antisense strand (reverse of mRNA)</li>
<li>So the DNA sequence that is actually transcribed is the reverse complement of the mRNA</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some genes are transcribed in the other direction - from the other strand of DNA<ul>
<li>It's more or less random which strand of DNA actually gets transcribed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does the RNA polymerase know where to start?<ul>
<li>Binds to a specific DNA sequence upstream of the place to transcribe, called a <strong>promotoer</strong></li>
<li>So just in front of the portion of the sequence that needs to be transcribed</li>
<li>So the promoter recognises this stretch of DNA by its sequence (e.g. TATA box lol)</li>
<li>All genes have some kind of promoter - not necessarily the same promoter of course</li>
<li>So these promoters are encoding information, but not for amino acids</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The three-frame problem: how does the cell know which reading frame to choose?<ul>
<li>Experiment: confirmed that coding regions always begin with methionine (ATG)</li>
<li>The first methionine codon that the ribosome can find signals the start of the reading frame</li>
<li>Ribosome consists of two subunits, one large one small</li>
<li>Small one recruits a methionine tRNA</li>
<li>Large subunit will sit on the p-site</li>
<li>Will start going along, grabbing tRNA as it goes along</li>
<li>Will replace each tRNA by another one as needed</li>
<li>N/amino-terminus: start of sequence</li>
<li>Ends at a stop codon (release factor - peptide that causes the compound to be released when it encounters a stop codon)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wobble pairing:<ul>
<li>Although there's a tRNA for every amino acid, there isn't tRNA for every codon</li>
<li>During the interaction of the anti-codon with the codon</li>
<li>For example: CAU should have AUG as its anticodon (5' to 3') but instead, it's GUG</li>
<li>Rules determine which wobbles work, depending on the anticodon position (5' end or 3' end)</li>
<li>tRNA also has a different kind of base called Inosine (I), can pair with A/U/C in the anticodon position</li>
<li>Hence, the degeneracy of the genetic code, and why you don't need one tRNA for every codon</li>
<li>(Because some tRNAs can bind with more than one type of codon etc)</li>
<li>Know how to determine possible anticodons made on codon sequences for amino acids and the Wobble pairing rules</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Transcription and translation can be simulatneous<ul>
<li>In prokaryotes, ribosomes can start translating mRNA before transcription is complete<ul>
<li>Not possible in eukaryotes, because ribosomes can't get into the nucleus, where transcription is occurring</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proteins can begin to function before translation is finished (before they've been completely synthesised)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Polysomes - many ribosomes for a single strand of mRNA<ul>
<li>Like a train of ribosomes, all producing the same peptide simultaneously</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>5.2</i>Mutations<a class="headerlink" href="#mutations" name="mutations">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Demonstration of link between mutation and phenotype - sickle-cell anemia (autosomnal recessive trait)<ul>
<li>Unusually high prevalence among Africans (heterozygous for it) - link to malaria lol</li>
<li>Main protein in blood: hemoglobin, binds to oxygen and carries it around the body</li>
<li>But in sickle-cell anemia, hemoglobin will form fibres, under certain conditions, instead of being soluble in the blood</li>
<li>Cause red blood cells to stretch, break and eventually die</li>
<li>Cause: change in the hemoglobin amino acid sequence</li>
<li>Experiment done by Linus Pauling - cut up hemoglobin into small pieces, using enzymes<ul>
<li>2-D gel to separate the peptide fragments based on their charge, in one direction (different amino acids have different charges)</li>
<li>And in another direction based on their size</li>
<li>So where peptides end up depends on their amino acid sequence</li>
<li>And it turns out there is one peptide in a different location for sickle-cell patients</li>
<li>Which is likely due to a different amino acid sequence</li>
<li>Later, it was sequenced, confirmed - sickle-cell anemia caused by a single base pair change</li>
<li>Results in a single different amino acid - valine instead of glutamic acid - which is enough to cause sickle-cell anemia</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Classifying mutations:<ul>
<li>Point mutations - small change in DNA (e.g. one base pair changed), usually affect one gene<ul>
<li>Missense mutation: single nucleotide change --&gt; different amino acid produced, so the protein is different (e.g. sickle cell)</li>
<li>Nonsense mutation: when something becomes a STOP codon, protein truncated early</li>
<li>Deletion (frame shift): individual nucleotides deleted, changes both the amino acid and causes a frame shift ... subsequent amino acids different</li>
<li>Insertion (frame shift): same as above except adding in a random nucleotide</li>
<li>Deletion (no frame shift): if you delete 3, you get rid of one amino acid, but there is no frame shift (skipping an amino acid)</li>
<li>Insertion (no frame shift): same as above but adding 3 (or a multiple thereof)</li>
<li>Silent mutation: no effect, due to degeneracy in the code (for example, TAG because TGA)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chromosomal mutations - large changes in chromosomes, usually affect many genes<ul>
<li>Deletion; delete a large chunk of a chromosome, removing many genes in the process (ex: bands missing in chromosome)</li>
<li>Duplication and deletion: unequal crossing-over (during recombination) - one chromosome has extra genes, the other, missing</li>
<li>Inversion: a piece of the chromosome is oriented backwards, often has no detectable effect if the break is between genes</li>
<li>Reciprocal translocation: recombination occurring between non-homologues (which shouldn't be recombining)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mutagen: agents that cause changes in the DNA sequence<ul>
<li>chemicals, radiation, viruses etc</li>
<li>Of course, even replicating DNA itself can cause mutations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mutations can occur in two different cell populations - somatic cells and germ line cells<ul>
<li>If a somatic cell gets mutated, then further somatic cells may be mutated, but can never escape the body<ul>
<li>Can kill a cell, or make it cancerous, or harm it or do nothing or whatever</li>
<li>Transmitted to daughter cells, but never to progeny</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a germ line cell gets mutated, then progeny may be mutated too ... that allele can be a polymorphism in the gene pool</li>

<ul>
<li>Viruses first discovered by Dmitri Ivanovsky - Tobacco mosaic virus<ul>
<li>Many tobacco plants dying of a disease</li>
<li>The only infectious agent known at the time = bacteria</li>
<li>But when he ground up the leaves, looked under a microscope, couldn't see them</li>
<li>And it had to be an infectious agent, not a toxic agent - even when diluted and transferred many times, still infectious</li>
<li>If it were bacterial, using a Chamberlain filter would get rid of the infections</li>
<li>(Filter whose holes were large enough for water to pass through but too small for bacteria)</li>
<li>However, when these were used, the infection was still transmitted ... so the infectious agent must be smaller than bacteria</li>
<li>So viruses were defined base on their disease-causing abilities and size</li>
<li>Initially, viruses defined based on their host specificity</li>
<li>Then later, based on their genetic material (some have only RNA, no DNA)</li>
<li>Several forms of DNA:<ul>
<li>Single-stranded DNA</li>
<li>Double-stranded DNA (e.g. chicken pox virus)</li>
<li>Single-stranded RNA (e.g. tobacco mosaic, influenza)</li>
<li>Double-stranded RNA</li>
<li>The above can all be linear, like us, or circular, like bacteria</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bacteriophage - viruses that infect prokaryotes<ul>
<li>Infects a bacterium, injects its DNA into it, uses the bacterium's ribosomes to replicate</li>
<li>Eventually you've digested all the bacterial genes, and lots of phage proteins etc</li>
<li>With T4, there is a lytic cycle - burst out of the bacterium, infect many others</li>
<li>Lysogenic phage - phage injects chromosome into the bacterium's DNA (now called prophage, continuous with bacterial chromosome)<ul>
<li>Might be done if conditions are not good - don't want to infect others just yet</li>
<li>And the bacterium does not know that its DNA has phage DNA, so it keeps replicating</li>
<li>In the process, the virus is replicated in all the host's offspring lol</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some phage have both cycles, others are only one or the other</li>
<li>When lysing, it's important to assemble all your phage parts before you lyse<ul>
<li>Done using promoters</li>
<li>Elements in front of genes, indicate when they should be transcribed</li>
<li>Early genes need to be transcribed first, then they can turn on the "late" genes, which are responsible for lysis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Phage are capable of exchanging DNA<ul>
<li>In a high multiplicity infection (when you can have more than phage affecting a bacterium at the same time)</li>
<li>Phage have only one single chromosome</li>
<li>If they have different alleles, they can recombine, like in prophase I of meiosis ... cis to trans and vice versa</li>
<li>Can influence what the plaques look like (dark/light/small/large etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eukaryotic viruses usually have an additional layer of complexity (often)<ul>
<li>Glycoprotein envelope on outside (coat)</li>
<li>Lipid bilayer membrane, with the proteins above embedded in them (sometimes, not always)</li>
<li>Nucleocapsid</li>
<li>Viral RNA/DNA genome</li>
<li>Binds to surface of the cell due to proteins on their membrane binding with proteins on surface of cell</li>
<li>Responsible for tropisms of viruses - the certain types of cells that they like to infect</li>
<li>Allows them to get inside the cell through a vesicle; the two membranes fuse, virus released into cytoplasm</li>
<li>Virus genetic material is transcribed; proteins made</li>
<li>These proteins go through the Golgi, then bud off, forming new virus particles (using the cell machinery - co-opting)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eukaryotic viruses can exchange genetic material<ul>
<li>H1N1 - mixture of various influenza strains</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HIV retrovirus - have RNA as genetic material when they enter the cell<ul>
<li>Also carries a protein called reverse transcriptase</li>
<li>Known to bind to proteins (CD4, used for finding infectious agents) on the surface of immune system cells</li>
<li>The RNA enters the cell, then makes a DNA copy of its RNA genetic material</li>
<li>Then inserts DNA copy of genome into the genome of the host, damn</li>
<li>And once the cell divides, the host will make RNA copies of the retrovirus' DNA, which is just the original RNA</li>
<li>So it will make new viruses just by replication ... the virus is now part of the host cell's genome</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Chicken pox - caused by a double-stranded DNA virus (varicella)<ul>
<li>Once you get over chicken pox, the virus travels through nerve cells, infects the spinal cord, lies there dormant</li>
<li>So you can get recurring infections - e.g. shingles (from zoster), virus becomes active again</li>
<li>Member of the herpes virus family - characterised by reemergent infections, difficult to get rid of</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>6.2</i>Bacteria<a class="headerlink" href="#bacteria" name="bacteria">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Bacterial replication - usually happens asexually (binary fission)<ul>
<li>Experiment with phenotypes - ability to grow on different types of media</li>
<li>One strain of E. coli, needs methionine and biotin for growth</li>
<li>Another strain, threonine and leucine required for growth</li>
<li>When you combine them, some bacteria don't need either ... due to genetic material being exchanged</li>
<li>Conjugation: sex pilus, tube formed between two bacteria, one feeds plasmids into the other, which has none</li>
<li>F-plasmid: necessary for forming conjugations; an F+ bacterium can form a conjugation tube</li>
<li>Then the bacteria that receives the plasmids becomes F+, can also form conjugation tubes</li>
<li>This process also allows chromosomal DNA to be moved</li>
<li>The plasmid gets inserted into the chromosome - Hfr (high frequency of recombination) strains</li>
<li>Bacteria have circular DNA, so they just insert themselves somewhere in there</li>
<li>Or, they can just recombine partly (like in prophase of meiosis I), the non-used part degrades; the rest divides</li>
<li>Experiment: allow bacteria to start to conjugate, then interrupt the process<ul>
<li>Frequency of a gene being transferred through a tube depends on how close it is to the origin of replication</li>
<li>Allowing you to map the genes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Transduction: "hitchhiking on phage"<ul>
<li>Phage accidentally carrying around a piece of bacterial chromosome</li>
<li>They can't replicate, but they can insert it into other bacteria, spreading those genes around, lol</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Transformation: moving DNA around on plasmids<ul>
<li>Some bacteria, enzymes increase in level to take advantage of increased lactose in the environment</li>
<li>In E. Coli - three genes responsible for metabolising lactose (Beta-galactosidases), have a promoter</li>
<li>The three genes form an operon - transcribed onto same mRNA; ribosomes make them into separate proteins</li>
<li>Lac repressor - between the promoter and genes; lac operator, prevents polymerase from binding and making RNA from these genes</li>
<li>Basically represses these genes during specific conditions (repressor molecule, binds to DNA)</li>
<li>But when lactose gets into the cell, lactose binds to repressor molecule ... allosteric regulation</li>
<li>The repressor molecule no longer binds to DNA, so the gene gets turned on basically</li>
<li>The reverse is also possible - the regulation of tryptophan formation<ul>
<li>If tryptophan is present, tryptophan binds to repressor, the repressor blocks the polymerase from making more enzymes</li>
<li>So, a negative feedback mechanism to create an appropriate amount of tryptophan (homeostatis)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What if you replaced the lac operon with the trp operon?<ul>
<li>Cells can build sort of complex logic circuits using these repressors</li>
<li>Sophisticated regulation based on what's present in the cell at the time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are also activator proteins - cyclic AMP receptor protein<ul>
<li>Cyclic AMP is usually present in high quantities in the cell in the absence of glucose</li>
<li>When it binds with protein kinase A, encourages polymerase to come and transcribe this gene</li>
<li>Bacteria weighs the relative advantage of glucose vs. lactose</li>

<li>Back to ploidy - greater ploidy, greater size<ul>
<li>One possibility: just has more cells (not true)</li>
<li>Other possibility: just has bigger cells (this is true, generally)</li>
<li>Cell size roughly correlated to genome size</li>
<li>So, possible to find impressions in bones of dinosaur fossils, which give the size of cells</li>
<li>From that, you can get the size of the dinosaur DNA</li>
<li>Genome size usually given in number of base pairs - the haploid number (so number of base pairs PER chromosome)<ul>
<li>So humans have 6 billion bp per cell but 3 billion base pairs per chromosome</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Although you'd expect humans to have many genes based on numbers in other organisms (e.g. roundworms)</li>
<li>Humans actually only have about 30,000 genes</li>
<li>Turns out humans have many more genes than they actually need</li>
<li>Large stretches of non-coding DNA between genes that actually code for things</li>
<li>Exons: things that code for proteins; introns: don't encode for proteins</li>
<li>When the RNA gets transcribed from the DNA, all of it gets transcribed into a primary RNA transcript</li>
<li>Then the introns get cut out, and the exons get spliced together, so you have a continuous RNA strand, all of it coding for amino acids</li>
<li>Experiment that showed this: heat up a sequence with an intron between exons<ul>
<li>Hybridisation: forms loops, so the exons join together</li>
<li>Through heating up and cooling down ?</li>

<li>There are enzymes that do this</li>
<li>Small nuclear ribonuclear protein - enzyme that consists of protein and RNA (RNA strand, essential component of enzymatic activity)<ul>
<li>Recognises specific sequences at a 5' splice site</li>
<li>Then loops an intron out, sort of ... splicing</li>
<li>Example of RNA processing (doing things to the RNA before it's translated by ribosomes)</li>
<li>Others: getting a 5' G gap, and polyadenylation (addition of a poly A tail)</li>
<li>G-cap: 5' end, guanine binds to the other 5' end, poly A's added to the end</li>
<li>Tells the cell that this is mRNA that needs to be translated</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Purpose of junk DNA?<ul>
<li>Telomeres: protects the ends of DNA, because there's an inherent flaw in the way DNA polymerisation occurs</li>
<li>When ready to replicate DNA, separate the strands, add an RNA primer (3' hydroxyl to start the process) - helicase + primase</li>
<li>So DNA polymerase III can then come along, use the primer to start transcribing</li>
<li>But then DNA polyermase I rips out the RNA, and there's a gap at the end, since it's a linear chromosome; that end not filled in</li>
<li>If you do this once, you get recessed ends on both ends of the chromosome</li>
<li>Every time you replicate the DNA, it gets shorter ... until eventually you have no chromosomes</li>
<li>Cell deals with this by creating telomeres. Short stretches of extra DNA, that are useless, on the ends of chromosomes</li>
<li>Acts as a buffer so that when it's lost, it doesn't matter</li>
<li>Telomerase comes along, adds a lot of random DNA to the end of a sequence</li>
<li>Telomerase is very important:<ul>
<li>Most human cells don't express telomerase; as DNA replicates, chromosomes keep getting shorter</li>
<li>Until they get too short, triggers a checkpoint, cells stop dividing</li>
<li>Part of what happens in human aging - your telomeres start getting shorter, eventually you run out of telomeres</li>
<li>Also, cancer cells often express telomerase, so they can divide indefinitely</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clicker question: 100 six-base-pair telomeric repeats on the end of chromosomes<ul>
<li>And primers are 25 base pairs long</li>
<li>You get maximum 24 divisions before you lose all your telomeres</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some non-coding DNA actually has a function<ul>
<li>Centromeric regions tend to have highly repetitive DNA, which is how cells know where to find a centromere</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, the vast majority of DNA that doesn't code for cellular proteins = transposable elements<ul>
<li>Pieces of DNA that don't really have a purpose</li>
<li>Transposons: encode proteins called transposase in their middle</li>
<li>Retrotransposons: look like retroviruses, only they aren't infectious</li>
<li>Non-LTR retrotransposon: have reverse transcriptase</li>
<li>Alu sequence: something</li>
<li>Transposons: have inverted repeats on either end, they can excise themselves, insert themselves somewhere else</li>
<li>Sometimes they land in a cellular gene, disrupting the gene and causing a mutation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reason there are so many transposons:<ul>
<li>When one moves somewhere else, it leaves a gap</li>
<li>Cell fills in the gap with whatever is on the homologous chromosome</li>
<li>So you get another transposon where it used to be</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Retrotransposons have an RNA intermediate, require reverse transcriptase<ul>
<li>Reverse transcriptase gene gets made into a protein by the cell</li>
<li>Makes DNA from the RNA, that DNA goes back into the genome, inserts itself somewhere</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-autonomous non-LTR: get transcribed, piggyback on reverse transcriptase made by other genes in the genome, same thing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pseudogenes: things that look like cellular genes, but without the introns<ul>
<li>So when reverse transcriptase acts on mRNA, making DNA that then gets inserted back into the genome</li>
<li>But, doesn't have a promoter or anything, so they can't actually do anything</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conclusion: genome is a complex ecosystem, transposable elements compete for survival</li>
<li>Which came first? polymerase gene (the DNA) or the polymerase enzyme (the protein)?<ul>
<li>Chicken and egg problem lol</li>
<li>Answer came from the study of self-splicing introns</li>
<li>Experiment: put RNA in test tube without any enzymes, as a control</li>
<li>Supposed to be a negative control ... but the RNA still got spliced</li>
<li>Turns out the RNA can fold into a structure that has catalytic properties, which then splices itself out</li>
<li>Ribozyme - RNA enzyme; can catalyse a variety of reactions just like proteins</li>
<li>Can hybridise to itself</li>
<li>Example: ribosomes are actually ribozymes, just RNA with a few unimportant proteins associated with it</li>
<li>So the first enzyme could have had just RNA, and this RNA resulted in ribozymes</li>
<li>Maybe there was RNA polymerase that could replicate itself</li>
<li>So primitive organisms could have been made by RNA that also acted as a lipid membrane</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Housekeeping genes ..?<ul>
<li>Cells that do not have a particular protein usually don't have the mRNA for it</li>
<li>So regulating the transcription of a particular gene - main method of controlling which genes are present</li>
<li>In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, RNA polymerase can regulate transcription due to promoter element (TATA box)</li>
<li>Which is usually about 25 bp upstream of the actual gene</li>
<li>Eukaryotes have three polymerases<ul>
<li>I transcribes rRNA</li>
<li>II: mRNA (most important)</li>
<li>III: tRNA and other small RNAs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Polymerase doesn't just bind to the DNA and transcribe; proteins of the TFII family prepare the way</li>
<li>TFIID - complex of proteins including TBP, binds to the TATA box</li>
<li>TFIID recruits other TFIIs that eventually recruit the polymerase II</li>
<li>Enhancers and silencers - unique to eukaryotes<ul>
<li>Can act from a great distance away</li>
<li>Can be inverted and will still work</li>
<li>Transcription factors bind to specific sequences; protein domains probe major groove of DNA</li>
<li>These factors determine what proteins are synthesised in different tissues</li>
<li>Example: heat shock genes</li>
<li>Genes can mix and match silencers and enhancers to get a unique pattern of proteins expressed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How histones affect DNA transcription:<ul>
<li>Heterochromatin, stains darkly; not transcribed in contrast to the lightly-stained euchromatin</li>
<li>For example, in females, one X chromosome is inactivated by condensing it, so it becomes unreadable</li>
<li>This happens early during embryogenesis; one chromosome chosen at random for inactivation in the cell</li>
<li>Then every daughter cell will also have the same chromosome inactivated (in the form of a Barr body)</li>
<li>Different cells will have different X-chromosomes expressed, so different parts of a female can have different phenotypes</li>
<li>Example, Calico cat - one yellow and one black allele</li>
<li>Some parts of the body, yellow allele activated; others, the black allele activated, resulting in patches</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rate of transcription can also be controlled by having multiple copies of the same gene<ul>
<li>Example: humans have like 280 rRNA genes, because they need them (to make ribosomes)</li>
<li>However, frogs have millions, because they need to be able to make tadpoles quickly</li>
<li>Called gene amplification - some cancer cells do this to become resistant to anti-cancer drugs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alternative splicing<ul>
<li>Sometimes, when introns are spliced out, so are exons by mistake</li>
<li>Results in proteins that are missing chunks</li>
<li>For example, you can mutate the doublesex gene in Drosophila to create transgendered flies</li>
<li>So you suppress neither femaleness nor maleness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RNA stability - must be unstable otherwise you only need to make RNA once and it would be around forever lol<ul>
<li>Example: excess tubulin binds to tubulin RNA, decreasing stability ... negative feedback loop</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Control of translation<ul>
<li>Changing the amount of capping</li>
<li>Factors binding to the RNA to prevent ribosome attachment</li>
<li>RNA interference: cell makes small RNA, does not encode protein, but complementary to mRNA that does</li>
<li>This RNA (siRNA) then binds to that mRNA with the help of the protein Dicer, blocking its translation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Post-translational controls:<ul>
<li>Kinases: enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins (important way proteins control each other's activity)</li>
<li>Selective protein degradation - proteins that there are many of are marked for degradation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trade-off between efficiency and speed<ul>
<li>Regulation is efficient because unnecessary proteins are not made</li>
<li>So no energy is wasted, but it takes longer or something</li>
<li>Post-translational regulation is faster but not very efficient, you make proteins that do nothing until they're activated</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Genetic engineering: taking a single gene from one organism, putting it in another, perhaps altered</li>
<li>Diabetes type I:<ul>
<li>Normally, when blood glucose is high, pancreas releases insulin, causes glucose to be absorbed</li>
<li>When low, pancreas releases glucagon, liver releases glucose into bloodstream for other cells to use</li>
<li>In diabetes, insulin not produced; you die, bathed in glucose</li>
<li>1921, Banting and Best purified insulin from dogs, could treat diabetes</li>
<li>Pigs were later used to produce massive amounts of insulin</li>
<li>But pig insulin isn't exactly the same - humans often had an immune reaction to it</li>
<li>Turns out there is one amino acid difference between pig and human insulin</li>
<li>1970s, idea - take the human gene for insulin, put it in a plasmid, transform into bacteria<ul>
<li>First problem: bacteria can't splice, so you have to put the gene in without introns</li>
<li>Do this by making a DNA copy of the mRNA that the introns have already been spliced out of</li>
<li>To do this, use the reverse transciptase enzyme from a retrovirus --&gt; produced cDNA</li>
<li>Second problem: how do you find the right mRNA for making insulin?</li>
<li>Answer - you don't. Just take all the of the mRNA in the cell</li>
<li>Put each mRNA's cDNA into a different bacterium, then try to figure out which one produces insulin</li>
<li>Plasmid used to carry the DNA = vector</li>
<li>Cut the plasmid so that it is linear</li>
<li>Then attach each end of a cDNA to the plasmid, recreating a circle</li>
<li>DNA is cut using a class of enzymes - restriction endonucleases/enzymes</li>
<li>Proteins that identify a specific 6-base-pair (usually) stretch of DNA, cut it at that point for both strands</li>
<li>This specific stretch called the restriction site</li>
<li>Then, pasting the two ends together requires ligase to form phosphodiester bonds between cDNA and plasmid</li>
<li>Usually, put a gene for antibiotic resistance on the plasmid (e.g. ampicillin resistance)</li>
<li>So if we put in some ampicillin, only the bacteria that have the resistance gene will grow</li>
<li>This phenotype (ampicillin resistance) called the transformation marker</li>
<li>Creates a cDNA library - every member of a colony will have identical plasmids, all colonies, different cDNA</li>
<li>How do you find the colony that has the insulin cDNA? Use a DNA probe (piece of DNA used to find complementary DNA)</li>
<li>Basically you heat a stretch of DNA, which pulls the strands apart</li>
<li>If you let them cool, the strands will find each other again due to hydrogen bonds between the base pairs (hybridisation)</li>
<li>The longer the stretch of the complementary sequence, the greater the affinity to the other strand</li>
<li>So you synthesise a short stretch of radioactive DNA that is complementary to the sequence you're looking for</li>
<li>Then you expose the cDNA library to the probe - should stick to the right colony</li>
<li>You can then find the radioactive colony - that's the one you want</li>
<li>For insulin, deduce a sequence that codes for insulin and synthesise the corresponding sequence</li>
<li>Due to the degeneracy of the code, you have to use a mixture of all the possible corresponding sequences</li>
<li>Now you have found the human gene for insulin and put it in bacteria</li>
<li>Next step, make the bacteria express the gene - give it a promoter and terminator so RNA polymerase will recognise it as a gene</li>
<li>Back to restriction enzymes - each one leaves a different, characteristic overhang when it cuts</li>
<li>And the sticky ends will try to find each other</li>
<li>So to get the insulin gene expressed: cut it out of the library vector with a restriction enzyme</li>
<li>Cut the expression vector that has the promoter with the same enzyme</li>
<li>Then you mix the two, let the ends find each other; again, add ligase to make sure it stays</li>
<li>Problem: sticky ends usually just go back to each other, instead of combining the way we want them to</li>
<li>To make sure the genes combined the way we want them to, we can look at the plasmid DNA using gel electrophoresis</li>
<li>Because DNA is negatively charged, will move in an electric field towards the cathode (positively charged end)</li>
<li>If you force the DNA to move through a thick tangle of agarose fibres (strings of sugars), will move slowly</li>
<li>How slowly, depends on the size, so larger DNA moves more slowly</li>
<li>If we know which size insulin should be, then we can find the right DNA</li>
<li>Now, the bacterial RNA polymerase will recognise the insulin-making gene, will transcribe and translate it</li>
<li>So it will make insulin. You can also turn this on and off with lactose</li>

<li>Positional cloning - cystic fibrosis<ul>
<li>Inherited, autosomnal recessive, respiratory infections - can't move mucus out of lungs</li>
<li>Purpose: find the specific chromosome and then the specific region the gene for cystic fibrosis lies</li>
<li>We could then identify and clone the gene</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Problems:<ul>
<li>Not that many human traits that show simple Mendelian inheritance against which you can map the disease trait</li>
<li>Solution: restriction fragment length polymorphisms</li>
<li>Variations in these sites will vary from one individual to the next ?</li>
<li>So, cut DNA with BamHI; you can then test for a particular RFLP using a PCR test (polymerase chain reaction)</li>
<li>PCR = method of producing large quantities of a short stretch of DNA using a DNA template<ul>
<li>Idea: two DNA primers that flank the stretch, one complementary to each strand</li>
<li>Mix the primers with the single strand of template DNA, heat, allow hybridisation (annealing)</li>
<li>Then use DNA polymerase to synthesise complementary strands of each piece</li>
<li>Primers bind to the 3' stretch of the DNA to be amplified on each complementary strand</li>
<li>Initiate polymerisation in different directions; you now have two double strands</li>
<li>Repeat the process; you get a geometric increase in the amount of DNA between the primers</li>
<li>So basically this amplifies a small stretch of DNA enough that you can run it on the gel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Problem with PCR - heating the DNA destroys the polymerase in the process<ul>
<li>Rather than add new polymerase each round, able to isolate polymerase from Thermus aquaticus</li>
<li>Bug that lives at 95 C in Yellowstone national park, obviously able to withstand high heats</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So then you amplify the region of the chromosome that has the RFLP of interest<ul>
<li>Then cut the amplified DNA with restriction enzymes, see if it cuts</li>
<li>If it cuts you have one large band; if not, two shorter bands</li>
<li>As a result, you know what alleles of the particular RFLP are present in that individual</li>
<li>Behave in a Mendelian fashion - you can distinguish homozygotes from heterozygotes (both long and short bands)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where do you get RFLPs from in the first place? trial and error<ul>
<li>Sequence the DNA of individuals, look for common polymorphisms that change the sequence of restriction sites</li>
<li>Look at people who have family histories of CF, look at their RFLPs, you can find RFLPs linked to the CF gene</li>
<li>You can then look at the human genome and figure out where on the chromosome the CF gene must be, roughly</li>
<li>But you still need to figure out which of the genes in that region is the CF gene</li>
<li>One way is through a cDNA library</li>
<li>Other way, computers - bioinformatics; look through the genome, find similar things etc</li>
<li>Find the difference between the CF gene in people with CF and people without</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sequencing DNA:<ul>
<li>Synthesise a new strand of DNA using the DNA of interest as a template</li>
<li>But make it inefficient at one nucleotide, so that it stops every time that nucleotide is added</li>
<li>Then you run a gel, see how long the synthesised DNA is, tells you how far it travelled before it stopped</li>
<li>Which tells you where that nucleotide is</li>
<li>Do this for all four nucleotides ... you can figure out their sequence</li>
<li>To make it inefficient, mix in dideoxyNTP which lack the OH's necessary for polymerase to continue</li>
<li>Do four reactions, each with a different dideoxyNTP model, four mixtures of DNA with different lengths</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Turns out, affected individuals have a small 3-base-pair deletion in an exon; removes single phenylalanine</li>
<li>The CF gene encodes a salt chloride channel - regulates chloride flow and thus controls salt balance</li>
<li>When it is defective, then the mucus that coats epithelial cells is too dry</li>
<li>Possible treatment: put correct CF gene on an adenovirus, infect CF patients with it, will replicate (not very successful)</li>
<li>CF has led to increased resistance against typhoid fever in the past, probably why it is still around</li>
</ul>
</li>
