        <p>Summary of Lab 1 for <a href="/BIOL_112/winter-2011">BIOL 112 (Winter 2011)</a>. Week of Jan 10, 2011. This lab is mandatory to confirm registration. There is no pre-lab flow chart or quiz for this lab. Note that this lab is basically equivalent to the first lab in <a class="wikilink" href="/BIOL_111/">BIOL 111</a>, so if you've taken BIOL 111 you'll probably be allowed to leave early.</p>
<p><strong>There will be a post-lab quiz on the material presented in this lab during the next lab</strong>, so it might be a good idea to take notes or otherwise pay attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Topic</strong>: The microscope: plant and animal cells.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="header"><i>1</i>Safety in the lab<a class="headerlink" href="#safety-in-the-lab" name="safety-in-the-lab">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Lab coats and safety goggles with side shields should be worn in the lab at all times</li>
<li>No contact lenses</li>
<li>Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) available for chemicals used in lab exercises<ul>
<li>Headings (probably don't need to know this, but just in case): product information, information on the preparation of the MSDS, hazardous ingredients, physical data, fire and explosion hazards, reactivity data, toxicological properties, preventive measures, first aid measures</li>
<li>Classes (same as the above): compressed gas, flammable and combustible material, oxidizing material, poisonous and infectious material (divisions 1 (immediate toxic effects), 2 (other toxic effects), and 3 (biohazardous infectious materials)), corrosive material, and dangerously reactive material</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>2</i>The compound microscope<a class="headerlink" href="#the-compound-microscope" name="the-compound-microscope">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Allows us to see at the level of micrometres instead of millimetres</li>
<li>Microscopes are expensive instruments, so don't, say, use them as makeshift baseball bats</li>
<li>They aren't really suited for hitting home runs, anyway</li>
<li>The one we use in this lab is called the <strong>Zeiss compound microscope</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>2.1</i>Parts of a microscope<a class="headerlink" href="#parts-of-a-microscope" name="parts-of-a-microscope">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>10x <strong>eyepieces</strong>, mounted on the <strong>binocular head</strong>; differences between left and right eyepiece can be adjusted by the <strong>dioptry adjustment collar</strong> on the left eyepiece</li>
<li><strong>Body tube</strong> (where the image is formed), leading to the <strong>revolving nosepiece</strong> where the <strong>four objective lenses</strong> are mounted:<ul>
<li>scanning objective: 3.2x</li>
<li>low power objective: 10x</li>
<li>high power objective: 40x</li>
<li>oil immersion objective: 100x (requires the cover slide to be immersed in oil, with the tip of the objective submerged in the oil as well)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mechanical stage</strong> that holds the slide against a metal frame; the slide and the stage can be moved using the <strong>stage movement knobs</strong></li>
<li><strong>Condenser</strong> that converges light rays coming from the light source; two lenses:<ul>
<li><strong>main lens</strong>: the main lens</li>
<li><strong>front (top) lens</strong>: smaller, use only for the 10x, 40x, 100x objectives; tilt it down for the scanning objective</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Condenser diaphragm</strong>: controls the amount of light that reaches condenser</li>
<li><strong>Illuminator</strong> in <strong>base</strong> of microscope; intensity controlled by a knob on the base</li>
<li><strong>Field diaphragm</strong> for adjusting the amount of light coming from the illuminator</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>2.2</i>Using a microscope<a class="headerlink" href="#using-a-microscope" name="using-a-microscope">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>It's a good idea to focus and centre on the slide using low power before switching to high power</li>
<li>The coarse and fine knobs should be used for the 3.2x and 10x objectives; for the higher power objectives, use only the fine focus kob<ul>
<li>Using the coarse focus knob with the high power objectives may cause the objective to hit and break the coverslide lol</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Oil immersion: place a small drop of oil on the coverslide, start with 40x, focus on the specimen (fine focus only obviously)<ul>
<li>Afterwards, wipe the objective lens with a dry Kimwipe, and the slide with a Kimwipe with a dab of Slide Brite</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wet mounts: put some water on top of the specimen, cover with a cover slide (try to get no air bubbles)<ul>
<li>Can use 3.2x and/or 10x to find, then view on 40x</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>3</i>Magnification formula<a class="headerlink" href="#magnification-formula" name="magnification-formula">&para;</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Total magnification formula: magnification of eyepiece x magnification of objective x magnification of binocular tube</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="header"><i>4</i>Examination of plant cells<a class="headerlink" href="#examination-of-plant-cells" name="examination-of-plant-cells">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Hopefully you know what cells and tissues and organs are by now so I won't go into that</li>
<li>Elodea leaf: first examine, then stain with iodine and examine again<ul>
<li>Elodea: freshwater plant, important in lake ecosystems blah blah</li>
<li>View on 10x then 40x</li>
<li>May be able to view cytoplasmic streaming (chloroplasts moving around the cell)</li>
<li>Draw the iodine through the leaf - place a drop at one side of the coverslide, place a Kimwipe on the other side</li>
<li>The iodine solution will then magically travel to the other side as if it were irresistibly attracted to the Kimwipe or something</li>
<li>The iodine solution kills the leaf (lol), but you will be able to see <strong>pyrenoids</strong> (starch-containing bodies) more clearly</li>
<li>Description of drawing: cells with cell walls, a nucleus and little chloroplasts streaming around happily within each cell</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cross sections (perpendicular to the main axis) vs. longitudinal sections (parallel to the main axis)</li>
<li>Selective staining: allows us to distinguish between different materials in the cells<ul>
<li>Because different materials take up different stains etc</li>
<li>Lignified cell walls --&gt; safranin (red), typical of thick-walled supportive cells</li>
<li>Cellulose cell walls --&gt; fast green (guess)</li>
<li>Starch grains --&gt; crystal violet (purple)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ranunculus acris (buttercup) root: prepared slides<ul>
<li>Drawing: an inner circle with a star-shaped gathering of lignified cells with thick red walls, and an outer circle with a cluster of thin-walled green cells with purple starch grains (probably where the food is kept)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>5</i>Examination of animal cells<a class="headerlink" href="#examination-of-animal-cells" name="examination-of-animal-cells">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>While plant cells have a thick cellulose cell wall, animal cells have no such thing</li>
<li>All cells have a thin plasma membrane around the cytoplasm though</li>
<li>Human epithelial cells, from the cheek:<ul>
<li>Use a toothpick to put some on a slide, cover with coverslide</li>
<li>Stain with methyl green solution</li>
<li>Drawing: should look like a bunch of balls with nuclei in the middle</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Small intestine of Amphiuma (cross section)<ul>
<li>Prepared; stain is haematoxylin-eosin, nuclei are purple, cytoplasm is pink, plasma membranes are stain-less</li>
<li>Drawing of cross-section: sort of like a tomato that has gone splat; villi projecting into the lumen, that's it mostly</li>
<li>Drawing of epithelial cells: each has a nucleus, line the outside of the villi</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kidney tubule (nephron) of Amphiuma (cross-section)<ul>
<li>Same stain as above, also prepared</li>
<li>Drawing: like hooded figures with really large hoods bordering the inside of an ellipse; those hooded figures are the epithelial cells</li>
<li>These cells have nuclei which enclose nucleoli, as well as a cytoplasm</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>6</i>Introduction to controls<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-controls" name="introduction-to-controls">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>A series of parallel experiments, each changing a single variable</li>
<li>Allows you to either confirm or discount a variable as either sufficient or necessary to produce an outcome</li>
<li>A way of eliminating alternate explanations for your results, and making sure that it was the tested variable that accounted for the results</li>
<li>For example, let's say you want to determine if spraying yourself with Axe will attract more girls to you than spraying yourself with cooking oil</li>
<li>So you set up an experiment with both negative and positive controls, and of course actually test axe as well</li>
<li>Negative controls: make sure that something does NOT do something<ul>
<li>Ensuring that the procedure is not observing an unrelated effect</li>
<li>To avoid false positives</li>
<li>So you go out into the world without spraying anything on yourself</li>
<li>Do you attract any girls? Hopefully you don't, because that will make the controls of this experiment simpler to explain</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Positive controls: make sure that something DOES do something<ul>
<li>Ensuring that the procedure is competent in observing the effect</li>
<li>To avoid false negatives</li>
<li>So you go out into the world with Axe sprayed liberally all over your body; this should cause many girls to flock to you</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And then you spray yourself with cooking oil and compare to the controls<ul>
<li>If you still attract a flock of girls, then you know that it was the cooking oil and not, say, your charming personality that caused it</li>
<li>And if you don't attract any girls, then it just means that the cooking oil is not as effective as Axe at attracting girls, and perhaps logically so</li>
<li>In any case, either way you've managed to narrow it down to your usage of Axe and cooking oil</li>
<li>Plus, with your positive control, you've shown that Axe should attract girls, and so for cooking oil to be as effective, it ought to do the same</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A probably better experiment (I think it was in the lab manual) would have to do with flour and flour substitute in a cake<ul>
<li>Negative control = neither flour nor flour substitute</li>
<li>Positive control = flour only</li>
<li>Experiment = flour substitute</li>
<li>The negative control experiment will have a pretty bad cake, confirming that without flour, cake = bed</li>
<li>The positive control experiment will have a pretty awesome confirm, confirming that with flour, cake = good</li>
<li>And since you want to see if the flour substitute will be as good as flour, you perform the experiment</li>
<li>This will probably show you that the flour substitute is not as good as flour in terms of making a good cake</li>
<li>However, you will have learned the basics of using controls, so no harm done really</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="header"><i>7</i>Drawings<a class="headerlink" href="#drawings" name="drawings">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>An Elodea thorn cell and two adjacent cells</li>
<li>Representative cells of Ranunculus root</li>
<li>A small group of cheek cells</li>
<li>Either epithelial cells of Amphiuma intestine or tubule cells of Amphiuma kidney</li>
</ul>
