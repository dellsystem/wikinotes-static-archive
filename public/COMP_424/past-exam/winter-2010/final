<ul>
<li>(a) If <span>$h$</span> is admissible, for what numbers <span>$a$</span> is <span>$a\cdot h$</span> admissible? Also, If we know nothing about <span>$h$</span>, is there a value of <span>$a$</span> that would make <span>$a\cdot h$</span> a better heuristic for A*?</li>
<li>(b) If we can do alpha-beta search for a game-player to depth <span>$k$</span>, do we get a better player by doing it up to depth <span>$k+1$</span>?</li>
<li>(c) Beam search: for every node, we only queue the <span>$k$</span> best successors, according to <span>$f = g+h$</span>. If the heuristic is admissible, will we always find the optimal solution?</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>1.2</i>Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#solution" name="solution">&para;</a></h3>
<p>(a) We need <span>$0 \leq a \leq 1$</span> (remember that costs can't be negative). And, no, <span>$a\cdot h$</span> is not better than <span>$h$</span> for any <span>$a &lt; 1$</span>, and if <span>$a=1$</span> then <span>$a\cdot h = h$</span> so it's the same.<br />
(b) No, because you'll end up on the opponent's move, according to Doina's solutions. I have a problem with this answer because how do you know that you don't end up on the opponent's move for depth <span>$k$</span>? I think my original answer - that it depends on the heuristic - is more accurate.<br />
(c) No. After all, the trivial heuristic is admissible. If we can only enqueue the first <span>$k$</span>, there's no guarantee that we'll find the optimal solution, unless <span>$k$</span> happens to be <span>$\geq$</span> the maximum number of successors of a node.</p>

<p>In Doina's solutions, there is only one variable, with 12 possible values (0-8 bomb-having neighbours, unknown, bomb, clear) but I don't really think that makes sense. Isn't "clear" the same as having 0 bomb-possessing neighbours? There's an assignment from an AI class at Berkeley which has a similar question, and the <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa08/w2solution.pdf">solutions</a> suggest 2 variables. - <a href="/users/dellsystem">@dellsystem</a></p>

<p>(a) Yeah. Assuming the predictors output <span>$\pm 1$</span>, just make the weights 1 and set the threshold to 0.<br />
(b) It doesn't<br />
(c) No, that would be silly<br />

<p>Suppose Doina has information on various binary attributes of all her students ("is graduating this semester", "started studying for the exam the night before", "learned how to play Odd", etc). For random subset of <span>$n$</span> students, she has decided whether the student will get an A or a D in the course. She then creates a program that takes care of the tedious task of assigning grades to students so she won't have to actually grade any of our exams or assignments. The program works like this: given a student, if that student's grade has been pre-decided, then that grade is outputted; otherwise, a grade (A or D) is chosen randomly.</p>
<p>(a) What's the training error?<br />
(b) Suppose the random subset of students whose grades have been pre-decided is of size <span>$k$</span>. What's the expected error for testing against a randomly-chosen student from the class? What happens to this error as <span>$k$</span> increases?<br />
(c) What's the expected error for testing against a randomly-chosen student the algorithm has <em>not</em> seen, as a function of <span>$k$</span>?<br />
(d) Would cross-validation evaluate the error of this algorithm correctly?<br />
(e) Did you learn how to play Odd?</p>
<h3 class="header"><i>6.2</i>Solution<a class="headerlink" href="#solution_5" name="solution_5">&para;</a></h3>
<p>(a) 0 because you just memorise shit (so any output will be correct for anything in the training set)<br />
(b) <span>$n-k$</span> students are not in the training set. Since this is a binary classifier, there is a 1/2 chance that any student not in the training set will be classified incorrectly. So the error is</p>
<p><span>$$\frac{n-k}{2n} = \frac{1}{2} \left (1 - \frac{k}{n}\right)$$</span></p>
<p>As <span>$k \to n$</span>, this error tends towards 0.</p>
<p>(c) <span>$1/2$</span> (independent of <span>$k$</span> lol)<br />
(d) Yes, because you don't test on items in your training set for cross-validation, so the evaluated error will be <span>$1/2$</span>, as it should be.<br />
(e) I'm an amazing Odd progamer, you should watch my stream sometime</p>

<p>If this exam were held in the cineplex, then we would all be able to watch a movie afterwards. Consider a student in this class, John Doe, who plans to watch a movie after every exam. If John does well on an exam, then he'll like the movie with probability 0.8. If he fails, then he'll like sci-fi movies with probability 0.8, and non-sci-fi movies with probability 0.5. There's a 0.6 chance that John will do well on any given exam. There's a 0.5 chance that the cineplex is showing a sci-fi film. Presumably the cinema only shows one film at a time.</p>
<p>(a) Draw the Bayes net (specify graph structures, parameters)<br />
(b) What's the probability that John likes the movie he sees after the AI exam?<br />
(c) If John has 10 exams in the cineplex (poor guy), and watches exactly one movie after every single one of them, what is the expected number of movies that he'll like?<br />
(d) John buys popcorn 70% of the time when watching a sci-fi movie and 50% of the time when watching other movies. Does this change the Bayes net structure? How often should the cineplex show sci-fi movies? (Remember that John is not the only person in the world.)</p>

Rewards: +1 in the right room, 0 in the other room, 0 in the start position.<br />
Note: rewards are on actions, not states, so you reward every action from the right room with +1.</p>
<p>(b) If you're in the right room, stay there. If you're in the left room, continue to try to move to the right room until successful, and then stay there.</p>
<p>(c) V(R) = 1 + discount * V(R)<br />
    V(L) = 0 + discount * (3/4 * V(R) + 1/4 * V(L)<br />
    solving this system of equations leads to:<br />
    V(R) = 2<br />
    V(L) = 6/7</p>
<p>(d) TD equation is V(S) &lt;- V(S) + a [r(t+1) + discount * V(S+1) - V(S) ]<br />
    Start value estimations at V(R) = 0 and V(L) = 0<br />
    Since these estimates are 0 and you get 0 reward from the left room, V(L) will stay at zero through the time that you move to R, and V(R) will be at zero until you move to R. Then you stay in R.<br />
    V(R) = 0 + 0.1 [1 + 1/2 * 0 - 0] = 0.1<br />
    Then you move from R to L<br />
    V(R) = 0.1 + 0.1 [1 + 1/2 * 0 - 0.1] = 0.19<br />
    and now you're in L, but don't take any action from here and thus can't update V(L), so V(L) = 0.</p>

<p>Too long, going to quote directly</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You got a summer job at a sandwich shop downtown. The shop sells different kinds of sandwiches, each consisting of a type of bread, a type of meat (or substitute), a type of cheese (if the customer wants some) and a type of vegetable. Each day, you have to go to the grocery store and buy supplies for the day’s sandwiches. Bread has to be discarded at the end of the day. Meat and cheese have to be discarded after a week. Vegetables are discarded after 3 days. You know that customers come in randomly. If a customer cannot have the desired sandwich, she will leave and there is a 0.5 probability that she will never come to the shop again. Of course, customers pay different amounts for different sandwiches, and you have to pay for the groceries. Having taken AI, you want to optimize, in a principled way, the amount of purchases you are making. Describe this problem using any AI technique of your choice. Explain all the components of your model. What algorithms could you use to solve this problem?</p>
