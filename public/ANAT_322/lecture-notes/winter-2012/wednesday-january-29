<ul>
<li>there are two types of obese mice: ob/ob and db/db </li>
<li>experiments were done to see what would happen if circulation of those mice are connected. </li>
<li>Parabiosis (surgial union of blood circulation) experiments: <ul>
<li>between wild type and ob/ob mice: ob/ob mice weight returns to normal</li>
<li>between wild type and db/db mice: wild type mice loss weight and dies of starvation</li>
<li>between ob/ob and db/db mice: ob/ob mice also dies of starvation. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>explainations : something in the circulation. both mutants have defect in that factor in circulation or defects in receptor for that factors</li>
<li>discovery: <ul>
<li>ob/ob mice lack leptin, which is suppose to suppress appetite. union of wild type introduces leptin into the ob/ob mice so its weight returns to normal</li>
<li>db/db mice lack leptin receptor, thus have high circulating leptin. <ul>
<li>union of db/db with ob/ob or wild type introduce this high circulating leptin into those two types of mice. their appetite is thereby suppressed and they die of starvation. </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="header"><i>4</i>leptin and body weight<a class="headerlink" href="#leptin-and-body-weight" name="leptin-and-body-weight">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>leptin restores normal body mass in leptin deficient patients. </li>
<li>however, cannot be used for anti-obesity drug because obese people actually have high circulating leptin<ul>
<li>during starvation, leptin levels fall and that induce appetite</li>
<li>during fed state, leptin acts to reduce appetite and increase thermogenesis, preventing against obesity. </li>
<li>however, as leptin rises with increased feeding and fat stores, leptin action fails to rise futher : leptin resistance.<ul>
<li>basically,  leptin signals energy sufficiency rather than excess (when you over eat, it doesn't play a role any more) </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>leptin receptor is type 1 cytokine receptor family<ul>
<li>associated with JAK kinase </li>
<li>dimerized when activated</li>
<li>downstream effects are carried out by STAT (dimerized) as transcription factors</li>

<h2 class="header"><i>5</i>leptin in arcuate nucleus<a class="headerlink" href="#leptin-in-arcuate-nucleus" name="leptin-in-arcuate-nucleus">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>two populations of nuclei in ARC express leptin receptor:<ul>
<li>NPY/AgRP nucleus (cuz staining of NPY and AgRP show overlapping, suggest that they are express in the same population of cells)<ul>
<li>orexigenic: increase food intake</li>
<li>inhibited by leptin</li>
<li>also have ghrelin receptor (ghrelin is released from gastrointestinal tract)</li>
<li>GABAnergic </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>POMC nucleus<ul>
<li>anorexigenic: decrease food intake </li>
<li>stimulated by leptin</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>both group of nuclei project to Mc3/4R nucleus<ul>
<li>depending on orexigenic or anorexigenic signal is stronger, food intake or energy expenditure is illicted. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>brain specific knockout (using Cre and loxP mode) of leptin receptor shows obese phenotype </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="header"><i>5.1</i>blackboxes in leptin study<a class="headerlink" href="#blackboxes-in-leptin-study" name="blackboxes-in-leptin-study">&para;</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>knockout of NPY or AgRP or both have no effect on weight. However, when NPY/AgRP nucleus is removed, weight loss.</p>
<ul>
<li>a more precise experiment: mice with diphtheria toxin receptor gene hooked on AgRP promoter, when treated with diphteria toxin, AgRP neurons are killed --&gt; weight loss , mice die of hunger. <ul>
<li>However, this only happen in adult mice. These neurons are essential for adults to survive. </li>
<li>when experiment is repeated in newly born mice, no effects on weight. <ul>
<li>younger mice might have a compensatory mechanism for loss of AgRP neurons. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therefore, there must be some other player in the NPY/AgRP neurons (other than NPY and AgRP). <ul>
<li>it was found that those neurons are also GABAnergic (release GABA, inhibitory)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>experiment is done to see if GABA released by NPY/AgRP neurons have to do with lack of effect of NPY/AgRP knockout<ul>
<li>yes, chronic administration of GABA receptor agonist elicits recovering from weight loss in AgRP/NPY neurons-ablated mice. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>specific knockout of leptin receptor (in nuclei that are identified as a player in energy balance)  in mice show mild obesity relative to whole body leptin receptor knockout. </p>
</li>
<li>so we look at if it has to do with GABAnergic or glutamatergic neurons, since it was previously shown that GABA agonist can rescue starvation in adult mice with ablated agRP nuclei. <ul>
<li>leptinR knockout in GABAnergic neurons in mice show more dramatic increase in body weight than leptinR knockout in glutamatergic neurons. </li>
<li>so GABAnergic neurons are probably main site of action</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, out of all the nuclei we know that play a role in energy balance and are first-order neurons that contribute directly to obesity, AgRP neurons are the only ones that are GABAnergic and express leptin receptors<ul>
<li>however, experiment already showed that that neuron-specific leptin receptor knockout induces only mild obesity.</li>
<li>conclusion: there are other nuclei GABAnergic nuclei with leptin receptor that we don't know about yet. <ul>
<li>in other words, the majority of leptin's antiobesity must be mediated by previously uncharacterized first-order (directly being acted on) leptin-responsive GABAergic neurons. </li>

<h2 class="header"><i>6</i>Leptin and reproduction<a class="headerlink" href="#leptin-and-reproduction" name="leptin-and-reproduction">&para;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>starvation is characterized by decrased gonadal hormone, delayed ovulation in female</li>
<li>leptin administration to fasted mice recover fall in hormone level</li>
<li>both excessivly skinny and fat women are infertile<ul>
<li>skinny women: low leptin level, low lepin signaling, fall in hormone level.</li>
<li>fat women: too much circulating leptin, leptin resistance, low leptin signaling, fall in hormone level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>speicifc impariment of leptin signaling causes fertility dysregulation<ul>
<li>has nothing to do with body-weight change. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>leptin regulates reproductive axis by activating gnRH neurons<ul>
<li>but GnRH neurons don't express leptin receptors</li>
<li>so leptin probably act somewhere upstream. other neurons express leptin receptor and project to GnRh neurons.</li>
