<p><em>Acidic compound: if water doesn’t remove the material, use butanol and then soap+water.<br />
</em>*Seek medical attention as the last resort.</p>
<p>*Chemicals in eyes:<br />
<strong>wash the eyes with lots of water.<br />
</strong>Don’t use ethanol, antiseptics, ointments, or any material except 1% aqueous sodium phosphate<br />
solution for acid injuries.<br />
● location of the eyewash fountain: front cove at front entrance of the lab.<br />
Fire.<br />
● shouldn’t be used on burning water-insoluble liquids such as ether, carbon disulfide, and gasoline. Use<br />
either sodium carbonate, bicarbonate or sand.<br />
● Water sodium, lithium, and potassium fires are best extinguished with sodium nitrate or sodium<br />
fluroine (because water react with these violently). Sand is a poor second choice. CO2 is not effective<br />
● Fire extinguishers: one is right in front the door of Grace’s room and there is one by every pair of<br />
fumehoods.<br />
● Fire blankets: They are located right near the entrance and on either side of the front door.<br />
● If on fire: stop, drop and roll. Don’t run.<br />
First aid kit : front of lab by Mike’s office.<br />
Spills: washed immediately with plenty of water</p>
<p>Equipment and supplies:<br />
(what for and used in what labs)<br />
● Water condenser: (for distillation, both simple and fractional)<br />
● Separatory funnel: for solvent extraction.<br />
● Round bottom flask: for distillations and boiling at reflux<br />
● stillhead and adaptor: parts of the distillation apparatus.<br />
● Erlenmeyer Flask: a normal flask. good for recrystallization<br />
● Filter flask: a flask with a sidearm for suction filtration (thus it withstands vacuum).<br />
● Beaker: for preparing/holding liquids or weighting solids.<br />
● Buchner funnel: for suction filtration<br />
● Graduated Cylinder<br />
● Short-stem funnel (for hot filtration) and powder funnel (inside diameter &gt;12mm)<br />
● Drying tube: protect system from moisture. the tube is filled with drying agents.<br />
● Universal clamp (can hold a flask)<br />
● Micro Bunsen burner<br />
● Hoffman clamp<br />
● Clamp holder<br />
Laboratory Operations</p>
<p>● Assembling and dismantling ground-joint glassware:<br />
○ ground surfaces must be clean to start with (no tiny grit)<br />
○ use lubricant (Lubriseal or Dw-Corning silicone)<br />
○ use clamps at several points so the joints fit tightly together.<br />
○ Freezing: two joints stick tightly together<br />
■ occurs when joints are insufficiently lubricated, subjected to heat , or exposed to<br />
alkaline/acidic solutions<br />
■ is best avoided by dismantling the apparatus asap after use.<br />
■ apply steam over the outer joint might help<br />
● Cleaning and drying Glassware<br />
○ always clean right after use... standing makes removal of residues difficult<br />
○ to clean out organic tar<br />
■ scrape off as much as possible and dispose it in a waste crock<br />
■ rinse with distilled water<br />
■ to clean silicone grease add some acetone and warm it up gently.<br />
■ If the tar is acidic/basic, you may try rinsing it with dilute base/acid.<br />
■ scouring powder and water to remove remainder of tar<br />
■ End: soak in detergent: wipe the silicone with tissue wet with chloroform<br />
○ If glasswares were to be used soon<br />
■ rinse with fresh acetone (which is kept in polyethylene wash bottle)<br />
■ dry it by sucking air through it. BLOWING<br />
● Waste Disposal<br />
○ rule of thumb: dispose waste as instructed<br />
○ halogenated waste (waste with halides) v.s non-halogenated waste.<br />
○ some may have to be decomposed before being discarded<br />
○ aqueous solutions or water soluble liquids usually may be disposed of down the sink with a lot<br />
of water</p>
