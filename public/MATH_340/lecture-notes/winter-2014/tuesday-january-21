<h2 class="header"><i>1</i>Crossbar switches<a class="headerlink" href="#crossbar-switches" name="crossbar-switches">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The simplest kind of telecommunication network is a <strong>crossbar switch</strong>. This is essentially a complete bipartite graph (aka a <strong>bipartite clique</strong>), with <span>$N$</span> input ports, <span>$N$</span> output ports, and each input port connected to each output port.</p>
<p>Clearly, this sort of switch can route any permutation (encoding a set of input/output port pairings). On the minus side, this sort of switch is quite expensive to build as you need <span>$N^2$</span> connections. Furthermore, there is a large number of crossovers<sup id="fnref:crossover"><a href="#fn:crossover" rel="footnote" title="A crossover is a point at which two wires cross">1</a></sup>; this is also expensive and can even decrease performance.</p>
<p>To find how many crossovers there are, consider the following: every link from the top half of the input side to the bottom half of the output side crosses at least <span>$N/2$</span>. So there are at least <span>$(N/2)^4$</span> crossovers. There may even be more - the top half can crossover with the top half. But there are at least <span>$\Omega(N^4)$</span> crossovers. (It can't be <span>$\Omega(N^5)$</span>, since we're limited by the number of actual wires. I'm not entirely convinced by this reasoning but I can't find any information on it elsewhere so who knows.</p>
<h3 class="header"><i>1.1</i>Clos networks<a class="headerlink" href="#clos-networks" name="clos-networks">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A <strong>Clos network</strong> is a network that incorporates many small crossbar switches, encoded in 3 stages. Example:</p>
<p><img alt="Example Clos network" src="http://i.imgur.com/DlKEpO3.png" title="Original diagram; released under CC0" /></p>
<p>Let <span>$r \times n = N$</span>. We will use this new connection scheme to improve on the <span>$N\times N$</span> crossbar switch scheme we saw earlier.</p>
<p>The crossbar stages are connected by 2 perfect matchings. Between stages 1 and 2, the output <span>$i$</span> of crossbar <span>$j$</span> connects to input <span>$j$</span> of crossbar <span>$i$</span>. The same is true between stages 2 and 3.</p>
<p>Let's now analyse the cost of this network. Suppose <span>$r = n = m = \sqrt{N}$</span>, so that we have <span>$N$</span> inputs and outputs. We would have <span>$3\sqrt{N}$</span> crossbars total. Since each crossbar has <span>$N$</span> edges, we'd get on the order of <span>$N^2$</span> crossovers. So the total number of edges is <span>$3\sqrt{N} \cdot N$</span> and the total number of crossovers is on the order of <span>$3\sqrt{N} \cdot N^2$</span>, thus, we have <span>$O(N^{3/2})$</span> edges and <span>$O(N^{5/2})$</span> crossovers.<sup id="fnref:omega"><a href="#fn:omega" rel="footnote" title="Is it $O$ or $\Omega$???">2</a></sup> (We also have <span>$2N$</span> edges in between stages, but the <span>$2N$</span> is negligible compared to the <span>$3N^{3/2}$</span> so we omit it. Also, the crossovers from edges between stages is only <span>$N^2$</span> at most, which is also negligible.) This is quite an improvement over the standard crossbar switch.</p>
<p>Now we have to prove that a Clos networks actually works, i.e., that any incoming packet can be routed to any output port. In other words, can we route any permutation <span>$\Pi$</span> of <span>$[N] = \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$</span>?</p>
<h3 class="header"><i>1.2</i>Online routing<a class="headerlink" href="#online-routing" name="online-routing">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Suppose we're given some permutation <span>$\Pi$</span> in pairs <span>$(i, \Pi_i)$</span>, one at a time. For example, if <span>$\Pi = 365491827$</span>, then we'd be given the pairs in some order, e.g., <span>$(9, 7)$</span>, <span>$(2, 6)$</span>, <span>$(4, 4)$</span>, etc.</p>
<p>We must decide on a path for a packet immediately when that pair arrives. For example, when we receive the pair <span>$(9, 7)$</span>, we must find a path from 9 to 7. All the paths that we choose must be vertex-disjoint, to prevent blockage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Theorem: If <span>$m = 2n-1$</span>, then all packets can be routed online.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Proof: Suppose we have already routed <span>$k \leq N-1$</span> packets, in a vertex-disjoint fashion. Take the new packet <span>$s$</span>, which has destination <span>$\Pi_s = t$</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose <span>$s$</span> is in crossbar <span>$A$</span> (in stage 1), and <span>$t$</span> is in crossbar <span>$B$</span> (in stage 3).</p>
<p>Now, <span>$A$</span> has <span>$\leq n-1$</span> inputs being used so far, and <span>$m$</span> outputs total. The number of outputs that are free is given by <span>$m - (n-1) = (2n-1) - (n-1) = n$</span>, so there are <span>$n$</span> outputs available in <span>$A$</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, there are <span>$\geq n$</span> inputs of <span>$B$</span> available. There are <span>$m$</span> crossbars in the middle. <span>$n-1$</span> of them can't be used by <span>$A$</span>; <span>$n-1$</span> can't be used by <span>$B$</span>. But <span>$n$</span> are connected to <span>$A$</span>, and <span>$n$</span> are connected to <span>$B$</span>. By the pigeonhole principle, at least one of the middle crossbars is connected to both <span>$A$</span> and <span>$B$</span>. We call that crossbar <span>$C$</span>. Then we just route the packet from <span>$A$</span> to <span>$B$</span> through <span>$C$</span>. <span>$\blacksquare$</span></p>
<h3 class="header"><i>1.3</i>Offline routing<a class="headerlink" href="#offline-routing" name="offline-routing">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Suppose we are given the entire permutation at once and thus can decide all the paths at the same time (aka <strong>rearrangeable routing</strong>). Let <span>$m = r = n = \sqrt{N}$</span>. From <span>$\Pi$</span>, create an <span>$r\times r$</span> bipartite graph, and create an edge between <span>$i$</span> and <span>$\Pi_i$</span> for each pair <span>$(i, \Pi_i)$</span>.</p>
<p>The resulting graph <span>$G$</span> is <span>$n$</span>-regular. We showed earlier that we can apply Hall's theorem to regular bipartite graphs. So <span>$G$</span> decomposes into <span>$n$</span> perfect matchings. We can use one of the middle crossbars for each perfect matching, which gives us a valid routing, as desired.</p>
<h3 class="header"><i>1.4</i>Benes networks<a class="headerlink" href="#benes-networks" name="benes-networks">&para;</a></h3>
<p>We saw that dividing a crossbar switch into 3 layers reduces the number of edges and crossovers. What if we were to divide each layer into sublayers? If we keep iterating until we get <span>$2\times 2$</span> crossbars, then the result is a <strong>Benes network</strong>. I assume this will be covered next class.</p>
