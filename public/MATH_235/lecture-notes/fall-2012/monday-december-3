<p>Professor Darmon will be holding office hours next Monday from 10-12.</p>
<h2 class="header"><i>2</i>Matrix permutations<a class="headerlink" href="#matrix-permutations" name="matrix-permutations">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Last time, we saw that <span>$S_4/V \cong S_3$</span> where <span>$V$</span> is the group of 2-2 cycles (e.g. <span>$(12)(34)$</span>) plus, of course, the identity. We also started looking at an example with matrices: <span>$GL_n(\mathbb R)$</span>, the group of <span>$n\times n$</span> matrices with real entries. The permutation <span>$\delta = (12)$</span><sup id="fnref:delta"><a href="#fn:delta" rel="footnote" title="He kept saying &quot;sigma&quot; during the lecture but the ...">1</a></sup> would, in this case, indicate transposing columns 1 and 2 (the first two) while keeping the rest constant. We could also express this as a function - for instance, <span>$f: S_3 \to GL_3(\mathbb R)$</span> would be a permutation of the columns.</p>
<p>If we then look at the determinant of the resulting permuted matrices, we get a quantitative way of seeing the effects of permutations on orientation. Reflections, for example, are orientation-reversing, while rotations preserve orientation. The function for computing the determinant is in fact a homomorphism, <span>$g: GL_n(\mathbb R) \to \mathbb R^{\times}$</span> (can't have a determinant of 0 in this case) and so the composition <span>$h=g \circ f$</span> would be a function <span>$h: S_n \to \{-1, +1\}$</span>, which we can call the sign homomorphism (incidentally, a surjective homomorphism).</p>
<p>Consider, now, the kernel of <span>$h$</span>, which we will call <span>$A_n$</span> for now. The cardinality of <span>$S_n$</span> is <span>$n!$</span>, and the cardinality of the image of <span>$h$</span> (<span>$\{-1, +1\}) is 2, so the cardinality of $</span>A_n<span>$ is $</span>n!/2<span>$. So $</span>A_n$ (called the <strong>alternating group</strong>) consists of half the total possible permutations. Indeed, it contains only the cycles of odd length - recall from MATH 133 that flipping two columns will result in flipping the sign of the determinant. So cycles of even length result in a determinant of -1, and cycles of odd length result in a determinant of +1. The terminology gets a bit confusing now, because we refer to a permutation of even length as an "odd" permutation (because the sign is -1), and a permutation of odd length is an "even" permutation (because the sign is +1).</p>
<p>Since we can generalise any cycle as the product of transpositions, this rule makes it easy to compute the sign of any cycle. For example, the 3-cycle <span>$(235)$</span> can be written as <span>$(23)(35)$</span> (remember that we compose from right to left) and so the determinant is <span>$(-1)(-1) = +1$</span>.</p>
<h2 class="header"><i>3</i>Simple groups<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-groups" name="simple-groups">&para;</a></h2>
<p>A group is <strong>simple</strong> if it has no non-trivial normal subgroups. (Recall that the trivial normal subgroups are <span>$\{e\}$</span> - the group containing only the identity - and <span>$G$</span> - the entire group.) The most basic examples are the groups of prime order, <span>$(\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z, +)$</span> (are there others?). These groups have no non-trivial subgroups at all, much less normal subgroups, as a corollary of Lagrange's theorem (since the group order is prime).</p>
<h3 class="header"><i>3.1</i>Classifying normal subgroups<a class="headerlink" href="#classifying-normal-subgroups" name="classifying-normal-subgroups">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The last question on assignment 5 asked us to classify the normal subgroups of <span>$S_5$</span>. Here's how we actually do this. First we note that any normal subgroup <span>$H \subseteq G$</span> is a disjoint union of conjugacy classes of <span>$G$</span> (which are simply sets - specifically, equivalence groups - and not groups). The conjugacy classes in <span>$S_5$</span> are simply the permutations with cycle decompositions of the same length. So one class contains the 2-cycles, another the 3-cycles, another the 2-3 cycles (like <span>$(12)(345)$</span>).</p>
<p>Why is it true that two permutations with same-length cycle decompositions are conjugate? Well, there's probably a really nice proof out there somewhere, but I don't know it. Instead, here's an example that you can use to convince yourself that it's true. Let <span>$g = (123)(45)(67)$</span>, <span>$h = (357)(24)(16)$</span> (with <span>$g, h \in S_7$</span>). To map <span>$g$</span> to <span>$h$</span>, we basically need to send <span>$1 \to 3$</span>, <span>$2 \to 5$</span>, <span>$3 \to 7$</span>, etc. Let's create a permutation <span>$a$</span> that does that: <span>$a = (1376)(254)$</span>. Now, since <span>$a(1) = 3$</span>, then <span>$a^{-1}(3) = 1$</span>. So if <span>$g' = aga^{-1}$</span>, <span>$g'(3) = 1 \to 2 \to 5$</span>, so <span>$g'(3) = 5$</span>. Also, since <span>$a(2) = 5$</span>, then <span>$a^{-1}(5) = 2$</span>. So <span>$g'(5) = 2 \to 3 \to 7$</span>, so <span>$g'(5) = 7$</span>. So far, we have the cycle <span>$(357)$</span>. Starting to look familiar?</p>
